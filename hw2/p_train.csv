No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,joy
"Hey, are you okay?",joy
"She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well that’s a",joy

"You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!",joy
Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.,joy
My whole mouth just filled with saliva!,joy

"That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.",joy
You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica!,joy
"Oh well that?s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.",joy
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!,joy

Oh yeah right there!,joy
Oh good.,joy
It’s Rachel!,joy
Great!,joy
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!!,joy
‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!,joy
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.,joy
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,joy
"So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate.",joy
"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?",joy
"So, yay!",joy
Damn! I am good at Cups!,joy
That’s right!,joy

Oh God I'm sorry!,joy
Thank you.,joy
Oooh it’s getting close!,joy
No! I’m so happy for them!,joy
"All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",joy
That’s right.,joy

"You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity!",joy
Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?,joy
I am so on board!,joy
"Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?",joy
"I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough.",joy

Ta-da.,joy
I’m like the one who talked him into it.,joy
"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!",joy
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!,joy
"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories",joy
"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.",joy
Try. There’s my little girl.,joy
Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!,joy
"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.",joy
Thanks.,joy
"I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough.",joy
Great!,joy

"Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!",joy
Yep! That's hilarious!,joy
"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.",joy
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.,joy
"Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!",joy
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.,joy
"You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity!",joy
"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.",joy
"Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!",joy

Look at me!,anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger

There was no kangaroo!,anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger
"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",anger

Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",anger
"Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",anger
I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.,anger
"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",anger
That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.,anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",anger
Y'know what? We need to move on.,anger
"All right, that's it. I want both of you out.",anger

That and arrogance.,anger
"Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger
Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.,anger
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!,anger

"Yeah, so do you.",anger
"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
You got problems because of you!,anger

"I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.",anger
So were done then!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!,anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him",anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
She’s saving the rest for her divorce.,anger
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,anger
"He's totally ok with seeing you!"".",anger
So what are you saying? It’s now or never?,anger
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!,anger
I found the picture!,anger
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!,anger
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,anger
I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...,anger
"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",anger
"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
Damnit!,anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...,anger
Yeah! Richard!,anger
"Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?",anger
"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!",anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?",anger
I’m not getting into this again!,anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!",anger
"Okay, I admit it!",anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
....right?,anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
"Y’know, it’s too late!",anger
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!,anger
"I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.",anger
I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.,anger
"It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",anger
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
"Either eat it, or be in it.",anger
You win.,anger
"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",anger
"Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?",anger
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",anger
All right?,anger
"Well, fine.",anger
It’s not a real game! I made it up!,anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
And we're not a couple of suckers!,anger
"On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",anger
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,anger
That's it!,anger
"Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger
"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am.",anger
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a,anger
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",anger
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.,anger
Are you crazy?,anger
I am not a pushover!,anger
I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.,anger
No you don’t!,anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
Robert!,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
Go!,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",anger
"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!",anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?,anger
"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",anger
There was no kangaroo!,anger
"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.",anger
"No-no, let me in!",anger
"Yeah, so do you.",anger
I don't know! I didn't come with her!,anger
What?!  What the hell?!,anger
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!,anger
She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!,anger
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too!",anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger
All right?,anger
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",anger
Fine!,anger

"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!,anger
You don't even know me...,anger
"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",anger
I'm not listening to you!,anger
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!,anger
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",anger

"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
You’re a big scrud.,anger
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
"I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.",anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",anger
Come on!,anger
Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!,anger
The picture of my wife! In your pack!,anger
Your friends are outta here pal.,anger

Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
"All right, y’know what?",anger
"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.",anger
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!,anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
Joey!!,anger
"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",anger
"Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",anger
"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.",anger

But I didn’t want to.,anger
Guys?,anger
Nngghhh!!!!!!!,anger

"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,anger
"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",anger
Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!,anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!,anger
"Well, he made a move on me.",anger
Are you kidding?,anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger
"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",anger
It just keeps getting worse and worse!,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
MY SANDWICH?!!!,anger
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!,anger
Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?!,anger
Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!,anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
Not nice enough.,anger
"That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!",anger

"Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
Come on!,anger

Right?,anger
Just being friendly.,anger
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
I can’t!,anger
"Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?",anger
Joey!,anger
Please!,anger
"On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
Okay. But not about this!,anger
You stole the phone!,anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
Joey!,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",anger
Ooh!,anger
And stop using my name!,anger
That’s why I’m here.,anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
"Walls are pretty thin, guys!",anger
"Either eat it, or be in it.",anger
...Now,anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,anger
Oh yes!,anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger

"Either eat it, or be in it.",anger
Look at me!,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
"No, we’re not!!",anger
"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know?",anger
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",anger
"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am.",anger
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",anger
This game makes no sense!,anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
Can I tell you something? Me too.,anger
"We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!",anger
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,anger
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",anger
Can I tell you something? Me too.,anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",anger
Fine!,anger
Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!,anger
"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",anger
"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",anger
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
Well it's not flexed right now!,anger
Big deal!,anger
"Hey-hey, y’know what?",anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!",anger
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
One!  No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!,anger
You had no relationship!!,anger
I'm not jealous.,anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
Oh yeah.,anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
It’s not fair Ross we got here first!,anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
We're academics.,anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
"Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
Get out!!,anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
"Okay, fine!",anger
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.,anger
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?,anger
"All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",anger
Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?,anger
"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??",anger
Hating you!,anger
"Ok, you weren't there.",anger
Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,anger
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,anger
Stop making candy!,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
No Rachel! They got here first!,anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
"Come on Phoebe, look at that!",anger
Or?,anger
"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",anger
Now go!,anger
....right?,anger
I'm just taking you outside!,anger
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",anger
Please!,anger
It's way to hot.,anger
"Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even",anger
"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",anger
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,anger
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",anger
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!,anger
"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",anger
We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.,anger
"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",anger
Big deal!,anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
Don’t call us that!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",anger
"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
Get out!!,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
Hating you!,anger
You still love me?,anger
Yeah!,anger
People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!,anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
"We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!",anger
"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",anger
"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,anger
I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!,anger
"I'm like the bing, bing, bing.",anger
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!,anger
Come on!,anger
They’re having their baby!,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
You still love me?,anger
"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.",anger
Oh crap!,anger
Nothing.,anger
Are you kidding me?!,anger
I’m gonna go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you.,anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,anger
"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",anger
You are not supposed to give people advice!,anger
Big deal!,anger
I mean everyone will leave!,anger
"Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",anger
"No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
Would you stop that!,anger
I am not a pushover!,anger
Please!,anger
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!,anger
Y'know what? We need to move on.,anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
You know what else I’m not gonna miss?,anger
"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",anger
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,anger
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",anger
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",anger
Shut up! This place is a hole!,anger
Ah whatever!,anger
Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?,anger
Yowza,anger
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!,anger
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.,anger
No!,anger
"No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.",anger
"Choose, you jackass!",anger
I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
"So, just tell me the truth!",anger
"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",anger
The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,anger
We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half!,anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,anger
"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",anger
Oh b-b-but it is!,anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.",anger
"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",anger
Nine times!,anger
"Aw, I know all about Kip!",anger
"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",anger
You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!,anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
"Oh God, stop with the plan!",anger
"Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?",anger
Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?,anger
It creeps me out!,anger
"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",anger
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,anger
Do not speak ill of the dead.,anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
You are not supposed to give people advice!,anger
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,anger
"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.",anger
Do not speak ill of the dead.,anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A,anger
"Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s.",anger
"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",anger
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
Are you kidding?,anger
That’s right!,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
I know. I’m mad at me too.,anger
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",anger
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,anger
Hey!,anger
"No, the quiet down thing!",anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",anger
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!",anger
"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",anger
"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!",anger
It creeps me out!,anger
Good for you!!,anger
"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!",anger
Joey!!,anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
"Well, it’s about time.",anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
"Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",anger
"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",anger
Fine.,anger
Thank you!,anger
No Rachel! They got here first!,anger
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger
Hey! I offered to marry her!,anger
I am strong! I’ll show you!,anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
"No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?",anger
Hey!,anger
I'm just taking you outside!,anger
"All right, I'm outta here!",anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
No!,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
Thank you!,anger
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!,anger
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,anger
...Now,anger
I don't know! I didn't come with her!,anger
"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!,anger
Come on!,anger
I won! That was my quarter!,anger
"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",anger
No!,anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.,anger
That doesn't mean anything!,anger
"All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
You did!,anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
You’re making one right now!,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Right?,anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
Get out!,anger
I'll go in there.,anger
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",anger
He does not look happy.,anger
"No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!",anger
And stop using my name!,anger
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
He obviously lost his mind.,anger
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,anger
"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",anger
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
Who's party is it?,anger
It does in mine!,anger
"Oh, hello liar.",anger
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,anger
Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!,anger
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",anger
I can’t!,anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,anger
if you don’t get that...,anger
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",anger
What the hell is that?,anger
"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",anger
"I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.",anger
Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,anger
You found my book?!,anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger
"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.",anger
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",anger
No I didn’t!,anger
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,anger
"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
Go!,anger
That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!,anger
"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...",anger
"Well, John McClane had plans!",anger
Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,anger
"All right, y’know what?",anger
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?,anger
Joey!,anger
"Or, call an ambulance.",anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",anger
Guys?,anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!,anger
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,anger
It's way to hot.,anger
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,anger
It’s not fair Ross we got here first!,anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
You gotta take the canoe!,anger
Who?,anger
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",anger
No! You let go!,anger
Go!,anger
"Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar",anger
"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",anger
Oh yeah.,anger
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger
Fine!,anger
All you had to do was buy the card!,anger
Nothing!   This is not over!,anger
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",anger
"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",anger
"And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!",anger
Guys?,anger
"Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
Joey!!,anger
Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,anger
"You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",anger
"Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?",anger
"And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea.",anger
"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
It's not funny!,anger
"No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!",anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
No,anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
It creeps me out!,anger
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
No!,anger
"Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.",anger
Do you know what just happened?,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,anger
You found my book?!,anger
Come on!,anger
"Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!,anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!,anger
"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",anger
You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!,anger
"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",anger
Good choice.,anger
"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",anger
Now go!,anger
"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",anger
"Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
"Please, what about you and Chandler?",anger
"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",anger
Fine!,anger

"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
"Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.",anger
What the hell is that?,anger
"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",anger
No! Never! Never!  Bye.,anger
Are you crazy?,anger
I look more like him than you do!,anger
"No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!",anger
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!,anger
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!,anger
"Comin' through. Move, move.",anger
"Hey, it’s my list.",anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!,anger
"And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.",anger
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?,anger
if you don’t get that...,anger
Good for you!!,anger
No! Never! Never!  Bye.,anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
Your friends are outta here pal.,anger
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!,anger
Uh-huh!,anger
Who?,anger
Fine!,anger
Fine!,anger
Stop making candy!,anger
I don’t have time for this.,anger
Yeah!,anger
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,anger
It’s not the pants.,anger
"Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are!",anger
Joey!,anger
"No, you messed it up. You’re stupid.",anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!",anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
"I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",anger
I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger
That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.,anger
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,anger
"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",anger
I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.,anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.",anger
No!! You have been screwing us all day!,anger
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?,anger
Please!,anger
Do you know what just happened?,anger
"Ok, gentlemen!",anger
"No, the quiet down thing!",anger
"Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",anger
"Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if",anger
No!,anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
It’s too late!,anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
"You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.",anger
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
Fine! Do you want something to drink?,anger
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!,anger
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,anger
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!,anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too!",anger
"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
Your friends are outta here pal.,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
"Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",anger
Ohhh!!,anger
But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!,anger
We're academics.,anger
Come on!,anger
"She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!",anger
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",anger
Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .,anger
"Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
No! You let go!,anger
That and arrogance.,anger
"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
Guys?,anger
Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.,anger
We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half!,anger
"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",anger
Oh not again!,anger
"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am.",anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
Huh?,anger
"Come on Phoebe, look at that!",anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
It's way to hot.,anger
I just came from the park!,anger
"I know, that’s why I said again!",anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",anger
Fine!,anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over,anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A,anger
"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
"You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?",anger
"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.",anger
Fine!,anger
Guys?,anger
"Ok, you weren't there.",anger
I am not high maintenance!,anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!,anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
Good choice.,anger
"You look at me, and it’s nothin’.",anger
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",anger
Do you always have to bring him here?,anger
Why aren’t you home yet?!,anger
COME ON!!!!,anger
This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at.,anger
Please!,anger
You stole the phone!,anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
Look!,anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",anger
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",anger
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",anger
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
Fine!,anger
I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.,anger
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
A week?,anger
I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!,anger
"Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.,anger
"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!",anger
Oh great! That,anger
Monica? Monica!,anger
Hey!,anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
Nothing.,anger
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger
"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
Don’t call us that!,anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
No,anger
"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
Can I tell you something? Me too.,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
Is that a secret or a lie.,anger
What?! No! It was my idea!,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!,anger
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!,anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
He started mine first!,anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
I don’t need you guys to care about me!,anger
"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",anger
HEY!! Do you,anger
"Okay, because I know that this is my Father.",anger
"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.",anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
I'm just taking you outside!,anger
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
Guys?,anger
It does in mine!,anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",anger
Fine!,anger
"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",anger
"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",anger
Who?,anger
Hating you!,anger
You still love me?,anger
I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,anger
"No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!",anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,anger
Hi!,anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
I don’t have ten minutes!!,anger
"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
The fake kind!,anger
It’s not a real game! I made it up!,anger
Ohhh!!,anger
Why does this keep happening to me?,anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,anger
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",anger
Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!,anger
Do you know what just happened?,anger
Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?,anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
I always knew she liked him!,anger
"No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!",anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
The little jail between the doors!,anger
You gotta take the canoe!,anger
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!",anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
Joey!,anger
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",anger
"I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",anger
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,anger
"Oh, I don't know, a million?",anger
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
Get out!!,anger
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",anger
"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",anger
"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",anger
Go!,anger
Nothing!   This is not over!,anger
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",anger
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!,anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
"Yes, good! Ok...",anger
....right?,anger
Joey!!,anger
"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",anger
Hi!,anger
Me too.,anger
That almost hit me in the face.,anger
Fine!,anger
Fine.,anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,anger
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
It's way to hot.,anger
"Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?",anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
Exactly! Because it's in the past!,anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
"No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",anger
"Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",anger
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,anger
Are you kidding me?!,anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
Uh-huh!,anger
He took my snack!,anger
Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
It was my quarter!,anger
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.,anger
Sing!!,anger
You win.,anger
Nngghhh!!!!!!!,anger
Fine!,anger
": You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?",anger
"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",anger
COME ON!!!!,anger
We are switching at the next rest stop and,anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!,anger
She’s saving the rest for her divorce.,anger
Hey!,anger
Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a,anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!,anger
"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",anger
We are not going to whistle.,anger
"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",anger
Nine times!,anger
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger
Guys?,anger
No!,anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
Ah whatever!,anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
We are not going to whistle.,anger
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",anger
"We just broke up, first thing she does!",anger
"No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,anger
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,anger
Ross!,anger
Get out!!,anger
It’s laminated!,anger
That’s my job!,anger
"All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!",anger
Okay?,anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
Fine!,anger
No! You let go!,anger
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,anger
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",anger
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,anger
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",anger
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",anger
Good choice.,anger
"Okay, stop!",anger
Oh crap!,anger
Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,anger
"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",anger
Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!,anger
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,anger
"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",anger
Phoebe!,anger
"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",anger
Nobody!,anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!,anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
Ow!,anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
No!,anger
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
Stop making candy!,anger
"Well, it’s about time.",anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!,anger
She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!,anger
"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",anger
"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",anger
The fake kind!,anger
Look at me!,anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",anger
"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
"Oh God, oh.",anger
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",anger
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,anger
Not nice enough.,anger
I took this picture from your fridge.,anger
"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",anger
This is unacceptable Rachel!,anger
"No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.,anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
Nine times!,anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
Almost never.,anger
This is our wedding I’m talking about.,anger
"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?",anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,anger
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,anger
Come on!,anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",anger
No!,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger
"Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!",anger
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",anger
This game makes no sense!,anger
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",anger
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,anger
"I mean come on, that is just noise!",anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,anger
How do you expect me to stay calm?!,anger
"You look at me, and it’s nothin’.",anger
COME ON!!!!,anger
"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",anger
"Well, fine.",anger
That and arrogance.,anger
"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",anger
"""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!""",anger
"Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.",anger
"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!,anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.,anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",anger
"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said.",anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
Get out of the way jackass!,anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
Right?,anger
...Now,anger
Your friends are outta here pal.,anger
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
Okay?,anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger
Go!,anger
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,anger
"In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",anger
Rachel!,anger
"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
"Oh God, stop with the plan!",anger
Come on more!,anger
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!,anger
What?!  What the hell?!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.,anger
"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.",anger
Come on!,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!,anger

She keeps lying to me!,anger
It’s too late!,anger
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger
Exactly! Because it's in the past!,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",anger
"No, I’m gonna!!",anger

Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!,anger
All right?,anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",anger
It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,anger
Who's party is it?,anger
"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",anger

No Rachel! They got here first!,anger
Go!,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
Why have you been following me?,anger
I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.,anger

"Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",anger
I mean everyone will leave!,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger

Y’know what? Forget it!,anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
No!,anger
"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",anger
Hey!,anger

"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",anger
Fine!,anger

"Okay, break-up’s still on!",anger
"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",anger
Am I out of control?,anger

"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger
It was the ring!,anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",anger
Oh yeah.,anger
"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!""",anger
"Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are!",anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
Ow! Ow! Ow!,anger
My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.,anger
"Well, this is my sickness!",anger
You’re a big scrud.,anger

"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",anger
"And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea.",anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",anger
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",anger
Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?,anger
"In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
Ross! Janice?!,anger
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger
I am strong! I’ll show you!,anger
Come on man! You've been here all day!,anger
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??,anger

"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.",anger
"I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!",anger
"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",anger
"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?",anger

You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!,anger
It’s laminated!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
Stop making candy!,anger

"No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!",anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger

"And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea.",anger
You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!,anger
Hi!,anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger

I could play the oboe!,anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
He obviously lost his mind.,anger
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,anger
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
....right?,anger
He started mine first!,anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
"He's totally ok with seeing you!"".",anger

"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",anger

"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
Uh-huh!,anger
"Okay, stop!",anger
Go!,anger
Get out!!,anger
He took my snack!,anger
"It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,anger
Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
If I can’t have it you can’t have it!,anger
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",anger
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",anger
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,anger
Okay Ross!  Please don’t die!,anger
"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.",anger
Let’s go big bunny!,anger
"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",anger
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
No! He blew us off!,anger
"No, you started it.",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
"Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar",anger

Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
You think you know me so well.,anger
"We just broke up, first thing she does!",anger
"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know?",anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger
Big deal!,anger
"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!",anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger

"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
"Ross, I am a human doodle!!",anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger

"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.",anger
"No-no, let me in!",anger

I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,anger
"Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl!",anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,anger
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?,anger

"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger

"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger
Now go!,anger
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",anger

"I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.",anger
"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",anger
Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
Are you kidding me?!,anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.",anger

"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",anger
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",anger

And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
"I do not always have to be—okay, okay.",anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
"Aw, I know all about Kip!",anger
"I know, that’s why I said again!",anger
"Okay, break-up’s still on!",anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger

The little jail between the doors!,anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",anger
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",anger
"Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.",anger
"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",anger
"Okay, you go!",anger
We have no choice!,anger
"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.",anger
Right here!,anger
Guys?,anger
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger
Oh! Here we,anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger

"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.",anger
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?,anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger

Huh?,anger
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!,anger
"Well, are any of those people here?!",anger
"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!",anger
"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.",anger
Fine!,anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
"Well, it’s about time.",anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",anger
"Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",anger

"Okay, I admit it!",anger
I took this picture from your fridge.,anger
Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a,anger

She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!,anger
Hey! I offered to marry her!,anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
I mean everyone will leave!,anger
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
Get Out!,anger

I am not a pushover!,anger
"Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!",anger
Hey!,anger
"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him",anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
Get out!!,anger
"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
Don’t you point your pants at me!,anger

Ahhh..,anger

Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a,anger
You don’t play the oboe!,anger
Phoebe and Rachel!,anger
"Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",anger
No,anger
"Okay, you go!",anger
"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.",anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?",anger
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",anger
Okay?,anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!,anger
"Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!",anger
Guys?,anger
I took this picture from your fridge.,anger
Guys?,anger
I don’t have ten minutes!!,anger
"In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",anger
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!,anger
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!,anger
"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do.""",anger
I won! That was my quarter!,anger
Oh great! That,anger
Would you tell her I let you win please?,anger
What kind of father do you think I am?,anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about.,anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
"Monica, leave him alone",anger
"Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s.",anger
Yeah!,anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",anger
"No, the quiet down thing!",anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
"Chandler, we have talked about this.",anger
Please!,anger
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,anger
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!,anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
"Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",anger
"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?",anger
Would you stop that!,anger
"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",anger
"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",anger
Okay?,anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.",anger
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",anger
"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!",anger
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!,anger
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!,anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
He started it!,anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
It's way to hot.,anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
Why does this keep happening to me?,anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.,anger
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,anger
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!,anger
Joey!,anger
He obviously lost his mind.,anger
He obviously lost his mind.,anger
No!,anger
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,anger
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!,anger
No!! You have been screwing us all day!,anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
She’s saving the rest for her divorce.,anger
All the time!,anger
"All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!",anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
Stupid closet full of bugs!,anger
What woman?!,anger
"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",anger
You can't have it.,anger
"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",anger
This is our wedding I’m talking about.,anger
We are not going to whistle.,anger
Fine! Do you want something to drink?,anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
Damnit!,anger
Ross!,anger
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",anger
"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.",anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",anger
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.",anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",anger
"Okay, I admit it!",anger
"Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!",anger
"Ross, what's the matter?",anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
"Y’know, it’s too late!",anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
You already got the first class tickets.. you got the lounge!,anger
I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,anger
Please!,anger
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!,anger
"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",anger
It was the ring!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.,anger
No!,anger
"No, you messed it up. You’re stupid.",anger
Sing!!,anger
"Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",anger
"No, the quiet down thing!",anger
"Okay, break-up’s still on!",anger
"Monica, leave him alone",anger
"Monica, leave him alone",anger
"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",anger
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,anger
"Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
Out,anger
I can’t!,anger
"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too!",anger
"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",anger
Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.,anger
Fine!,anger
"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.",anger
Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!,anger
Not nice enough.,anger
You said I was boring--Ohh!,anger
"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",anger
"I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.",anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
Please!,anger

I don’t accept this rule.,anger
"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!",anger
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!,anger
"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.",anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
How'd you get to that?,anger
Come on!,anger
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",anger
That—It’s not the same thing! This is,anger
The fake kind!,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.,anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,anger
"I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.",anger
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??,anger
Great. So the ball is in his court?,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
...Now,anger
So were done then!,anger
Look at you. All jealous.,anger
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?,anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",anger
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!,anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!",anger
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!,anger
"All right, that's it. I want both of you out.",anger
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!,anger
"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
No!,anger
"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",anger
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",anger
It creeps me out!,anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.,anger
Fine.,anger
"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!",anger
She’s saving the rest for her divorce.,anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
No!,anger
"Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
And it wouldn’t matter.,anger
Stop callin’!!,anger
No! No! No!,anger
"Hey, I've been honing!",anger
"Hey, come on now!",anger
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
You gotta take the canoe!,anger
HEY!! Do you,anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!",anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
"And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!,anger
I'll go in there.,anger
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!,anger
Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?,anger
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,anger
I am not a pushover!,anger
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a,anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",anger
"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
"Ross, I am a human doodle!!",anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.",anger
"Choose, you jackass!",anger
Come on!,anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.",anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.,anger
"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks.",anger
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",anger
"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",anger
"Hey, come on now!",anger
Noo!,anger
"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",anger
"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.",anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?,anger
No!,anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,anger
It was the ring!,anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
Fine!,anger
No Rachel! They got here first!,anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!,anger
No!! You have been screwing us all day!,anger
"""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!""",anger
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
You are not supposed to give people advice!,anger
Oh crap!,anger
That—It’s not the same thing! This is,anger
"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",anger
Do you know what just happened?,anger
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!,anger
Why does this keep happening to me?,anger
Me too.,anger
Yeah!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
Oh crap!,anger
Go!,anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.",anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger
"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",anger
I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!,anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
"Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.",anger
But I didn’t want to.,anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
"Okay, because I know that this is my Father.",anger
Ross! Janice?!,anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
"You look at me, and it’s nothin’.",anger
And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!,anger
"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",anger
"No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",anger
"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",anger
"Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.",anger
"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",anger
No I’m not.,anger
...Now,anger
Oh crap!,anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.",anger
"And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!",anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",anger
Joey!,anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
What are you talking about? Bitch.,anger
No!,anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,anger
Hi!,anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,anger
"All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.",anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
"A small puff of air, now come on!",anger
Thanks a lot.,anger
"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not",anger
"Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",anger
"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",anger
"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",anger
Oh! Here we,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
I am not a pushover!,anger
"That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!",anger
"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?",anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
Don’t call us that!,anger
You did!,anger
No!! You have been screwing us all day!,anger
"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",anger
"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
No!,anger
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.,anger
Fine!,anger
Hi!,anger
"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",anger
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,anger
Get out!!,anger
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?,anger
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",anger
Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,anger
No!,anger
"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
I'm not listening to you!,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
You’re disturbing my oboe practice.,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
Be mad at him!,anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
I can handle the stick!!,anger
"Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",anger
I'm just taking you outside!,anger
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?,anger
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",anger
"But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",anger
Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?,anger
"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
"Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",anger
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,anger
"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",anger
It creeps me out!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!",anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
Who?,anger
No!,anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
Out,anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger
"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!,anger
I’m gonna go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you.,anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
Guys?,anger
"Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.",anger
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a,anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
Huh?,anger
"I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!",anger
Hating you!,anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
It’s not fair Ross we got here first!,anger
"Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!",anger
No no no! Federal regulations!,anger
Noo!,anger
Do you always have to bring him here?,anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",anger
Who?,anger
You had no relationship!!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",anger
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!,anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
Fine!,anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
You. Like you haven’t done enough.,anger
He took my snack!,anger
Me too.,anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
That's it!,anger
I just came from the park!,anger
I took this picture from your fridge.,anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",anger
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!,anger
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger
"Well, this is my sickness!",anger
Fine! Do you want something to drink?,anger
I got no sleep last night!,anger
I mean everyone will leave!,anger
We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half!,anger
"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
if you don’t get that...,anger
"Choose, you jackass!",anger
Yeah!,anger
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",anger
"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",anger
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a,anger
Phoebe and Rachel!,anger
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.,anger
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",anger
"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",anger
"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",anger
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!,anger
You. Like you haven’t done enough.,anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,anger
"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks.",anger
Nine times!,anger
"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",anger
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,anger
Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!,anger
"I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.",anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.,anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
Nine times!,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
"No, you started it.",anger
"Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",anger
"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?",anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Noo!,anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
No! He blew us off!,anger
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.,anger
"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??",anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,anger
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,anger
What?! No! It was my idea!,anger
"Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!",anger
Be mad at him!,anger
"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",anger
"Okay, I admit it!",anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
"Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger
Oh! Here we,anger
"No, I’m gonna!!",anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
"Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.",anger
And don’t you follow me!,anger
"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!,anger
Noo!,anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
Robert!,anger
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
Stop callin’!!,anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",anger
I look more like him than you do!,anger
No!,anger
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
Noo!,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?,anger
I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
"No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",anger
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!,anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
Right?,anger
"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!",anger
And it wouldn’t matter.,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
"I'm like the bing, bing, bing.",anger
Well we’ll see!,anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
"Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",anger
"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",anger
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
I talk to you and nothin’.,anger
"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?",anger
I know. I’m mad at me too.,anger
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,anger
Give it to me!,anger
A week?,anger
"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!",anger
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,anger
He does not look happy.,anger
It just keeps getting worse and worse!,anger
The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!,anger
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",anger
Please!,anger
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!,anger
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,anger
Thanks a lot.,anger
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,anger
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!,anger
....right?,anger
I said I’ll do it!,anger
"Ok, you weren't there.",anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",anger
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,anger
"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",anger
...Now,anger
"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.",anger
You’re disturbing my oboe practice.,anger
"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",anger
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,anger
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?,anger
"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",anger
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",anger
"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!",anger
I could play the oboe!,anger
Don’t touch him!,anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",anger
"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",anger
"I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.",anger
Please!,anger
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,anger
It’s not even a song!,anger
Right?,anger
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,anger
Come on!,anger
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",anger
I can’t!,anger
"Hey, this is so unfair!",anger
And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!,anger
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!,anger
Big deal!,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
Gimme the this!,anger
"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
"Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",anger
Fine!,anger
I don't know! I didn't come with her!,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
No!,anger
"I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.",anger
I want to do it again.,anger
I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!,anger
I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
Please!,anger
"Hey, this is so unfair!",anger
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
It creeps me out!,anger
The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,anger
"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!",anger
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.,anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
Thank you!,anger
Fine!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",anger
"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",anger
Joey!!,anger
Nobody!,anger
I know. I’m mad at me too.,anger
Ahhh..,anger
"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",anger
Nothing.,anger
"Well, fine.",anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
Thanks a lot.,anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
Exactly! Because it's in the past!,anger
"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.",anger
Look!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
I don’t have time for this.,anger
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",anger
I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.,anger
I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
"You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?",anger
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,anger
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
Are you kidding?,anger
Oh yes!,anger
"No suds, no save. Ok?",anger
"Why don’t you look in the mirror, scrud.",anger
"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?",anger
"Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.",anger
It's not funny!,anger
Oh yeah.,anger
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,anger
Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!,anger
"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
"All right, this has got to stop!",anger
My parents spent the money for our wedding!,anger
I did,anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
Now go!,anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
I don’t accept this rule.,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""",anger
Fine! Do you want something to drink?,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!,anger
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",anger
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",anger
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!,anger
Ohhh!!,anger
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!,anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
"No, I’m gonna!!",anger
"Well, are any of those people here?!",anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!,anger
He started it!,anger
It’s too late!,anger
No!,anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
No!,anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
Or?,anger
Come on!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
Well we’ll see!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
"Well, it’s about time.",anger
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,anger
...Now,anger
"I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.",anger
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?,anger
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
You gotta take the canoe!,anger
I know! Why don’t you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.,anger
"It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",anger
"No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!",anger
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,anger
Ohhh!!,anger
You found my book?!,anger
"All right, this has got to stop!",anger
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,anger
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger
I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!,anger
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
Oh crap!,anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger
Nine times!,anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
She keeps lying to me!,anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!""",anger
"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?",anger
I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.,anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
I can’t!,anger
That—It’s not the same thing! This is,anger
We're academics.,anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
I am not a pushover!,anger
"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!",anger
"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
Now I gotta be careful?,anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,anger
"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",anger
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger
Gimme the this!,anger
You know what else I’m not gonna miss?,anger
How'd you get to that?,anger
"We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
And we're not a couple of suckers!,anger
I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,anger
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger
And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were    gonna get away with that?,anger
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!,anger
"Ring dammit, ring!",anger
"Or, call an ambulance.",anger
No!! You have been screwing us all day!,anger
I’m not getting into this again!,anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!,anger
"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",anger
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",anger
Right?,anger
Get off!,anger
Let go of my hand!,anger
COME ON!!!!,anger
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!",anger
Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!,anger
"Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!,anger
Be mad at him!,anger
"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.",anger
Don’t you point your pants at me!,anger
"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.",anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
Fine.,anger
NOOOO!!!!!!!!,anger
What about me?! You-you just said I could!,anger
Go!,anger
Ahhh..,anger
He does not look happy.,anger
You’re a mean old woman.,anger
"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.",anger
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.,anger
Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!,anger
Almost never.,anger
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?,anger
Uh-huh!,anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",anger
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!,anger
It’s too late!,anger
"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",anger
"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",anger
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,anger
"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",anger
Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.,anger
Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!,anger
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
Nngghhh!!!!!!!,anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
"No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.",anger
"No, you started it.",anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
"I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.",anger
"You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",anger
I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,anger
Hey!,anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger
Get out!,anger
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
Great.,anger
"All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!",anger
No!,anger
"Hey-hey, y’know what?",anger
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.,anger
"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",anger
I know!,anger
"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!,anger
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",anger
"All right, y’know what?",anger
"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,",anger
"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,",anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
What the hell is that?,anger
No Phoebe I am mad!,anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
"Oh screw her, that part is mine!",anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
It's way to hot.,anger
"I said, ""No!""",anger
"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.",anger
You are not supposed to give people advice!,anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",anger
You’re a mean old woman.,anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.",anger
I'm not listening to you!,anger
"Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!",anger
Ahhh..,anger
He obviously lost his mind.,anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
I said I’ll do it!,anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.",anger
Get off!,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,anger
Fine!,anger
It's not funny!,anger
You went through my personal property?,anger
"Well, it’s about time.",anger
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!,anger
"Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!",anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
I highly doubt that.,anger
"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!",anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.",anger
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",anger
"No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.",anger
You stole the phone!,anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
"Please, what about you and Chandler?",anger
Do not speak ill of the dead.,anger
Look at you. All jealous.,anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
Chandler! He’s your father.  he should be at the wedding.,anger
You can't have it.,anger
"C'mon, she's your mom!",anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",anger
I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,anger
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",anger
Hating you!,anger
"What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",anger
"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",anger
"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!",anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?",anger
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.",anger
Guys?,anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
It’s too late!,anger
"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",anger
"Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
So if you can help me find my Father then you should!,anger
"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",anger
Phoebe and Rachel!,anger
What the hell is that?,anger
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about.,anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
Ah yeah—wait a second now!,anger
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",anger
"Why don’t you look in the mirror, scrud.",anger
Great. So the ball is in his court?,anger
Not so fast Wesley!,anger
It’s not even a song!,anger
"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",anger
What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid,anger
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.,anger
"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?",anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
"And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!",anger
"Come on Phoebe, look at that!",anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
I mean everyone will leave!,anger
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!,anger
"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",anger
Big deal!,anger
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!,anger
"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",anger
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,anger
That—It’s not the same thing! This is,anger
I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.,anger
"All right, y’know what?",anger
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
Out,anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
"Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay?",anger
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
Go!,anger
Fine!,anger
"Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",anger
No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
"On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",anger
Nothing.,anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
"Dude, this isn’t funny!",anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes.",anger
Oh not again!,anger
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!,anger
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",anger
Now I gotta be careful?,anger
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!,anger
I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!,anger
Just being friendly.,anger
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.",anger
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!,anger
I know. I’m mad at me too.,anger
Wait a minute!,anger
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
Ahhh..,anger
Thanks a lot.,anger
We’re here to celebrate our love together.,anger
"A small puff of air, now come on!",anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
And don’t you follow me!,anger
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",anger
"No, we’re not!!",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
"Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.",anger
Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?,anger
That doesn't mean anything!,anger
Oh not again!,anger
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,anger
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!,anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",anger
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!,anger
"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",anger
"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
No! No! No!,anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,anger
"You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!",anger
Yeah!,anger
It’s too late!,anger
Get out!,anger
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,anger
Guys?,anger
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.",anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
We are not going to whistle.,anger
That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!,anger
No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!,anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
"I do not always have to be—okay, okay.",anger
Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.,anger
She keeps lying to me!,anger
"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",anger
"Doogie, shh!",anger
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!,anger
"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",anger
She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!,anger
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!,anger
Noo!,anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
So were done then!,anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
"Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",anger
"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?",anger
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",anger
I am strong! I’ll show you!,anger
The fake kind!,anger
Really?,anger
You are not supposed to give people advice!,anger
"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.",anger
"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",anger
No Phoebe I am mad!,anger
"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",anger
"Come on Phoebe, look at that!",anger
Not nice enough.,anger
"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",anger
"Okay, fine!",anger
Noo!,anger
So what are you saying? It’s now or never?,anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?,anger
"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",anger
"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.",anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?",anger
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger
The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,anger
"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",anger
"Now, hold on!",anger
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",anger
"Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?,anger
Would you stop that!,anger
No! Never! Never!  Bye.,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!,anger
"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",anger
Guys?,anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
MY SANDWICH?!!!,anger
"Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?",anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",anger
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",anger
Big deal!,anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
"Oh God, get out!",anger
"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",anger
Uh-huh!,anger
Now go!,anger
I feel like I can't do stuff!,anger
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!,anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.",anger
Hi!,anger
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!,anger
No!,anger
Come on!,anger
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.,anger
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!,anger
"Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",anger
This is our wedding I’m talking about.,anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,anger
"Or, call an ambulance.",anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...,anger
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!,anger
"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",anger
"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
This sucks!,anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!,anger
"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",anger
Please!,anger
I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!,anger
"I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!",anger
"And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!",anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger
I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.,anger
It’s not the pants.,anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!,anger
I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!,anger
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
How'd you get to that?,anger
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!,anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger
"So Ross, what your problem?",anger
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...,anger
You’re the worst best man ever!,anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
Count in our heads as-as good,anger
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.,anger
"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",anger
"Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.",anger
I know!,anger
"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",anger
"Okay, you go!",anger
"That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!",anger
It doesn’t say that in the script.,anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
if you don’t get that...,anger
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!,anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
"Ok, gentlemen!",anger
She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!,anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
Huh?,anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!",anger
Crap!!,anger
Really?,anger
"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",anger
How'd you get to that?,anger
"Comin' through. Move, move.",anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
Go!,anger
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,anger
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,anger
Not nice enough.,anger
No I didn’t!,anger
Crap!!,anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
"Well, are any of those people here?!",anger
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,anger
Nine times!,anger
It’s you that is backwards.,anger
"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",anger
"Oh, I don't know, a million?",anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
....right?,anger
I'll go in there.,anger
"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger
I am strong! I’ll show you!,anger
"Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him!",anger
The fake kind!,anger
"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!",anger
"I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.",anger
"Look, forget about it, okay?",anger
No!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
"Even if people are on it!""",anger
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?,anger
"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",anger
"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",anger
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,anger
It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!,anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
You are asking me to be your wife!,anger
Be mad at him!,anger
That's it!,anger
Please!,anger
Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.,anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
My parents spent the money for our wedding!,anger
Stop making candy!,anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
"And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea.",anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!",anger
"Ah, it’s says so in the script!",anger
He does not look happy.,anger
Now go!,anger
"Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if",anger
"""We were on a break!""",anger
"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",anger
Get out!!,anger
Oh not again!,anger
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",anger
"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",anger
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,anger
Stupid Jane Rogers!!,anger
"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?",anger

"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.",anger
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger
"Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl!",anger
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",anger
"You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",anger
Sing!!,anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,anger
"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",anger
"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.",anger
I got no sleep last night!,anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
I’m not getting into this again!,anger
Look at you. All jealous.,anger
You’re making one right now!,anger
"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",anger
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,anger
"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.",anger
And we're not a couple of suckers!,anger
We're academics.,anger
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,anger
Joey!!,anger
And stop using my name!,anger
Well it's not flexed right now!,anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
Phoebe and Rachel!,anger
I don’t care! You just get him!,anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
Y’know what? Forget it!,anger
"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",anger
Stay calm?!!,anger
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,anger
"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!""",anger
Get out!!,anger
NOOOO!!!!!!!!,anger
I want to do it again.,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger

"That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!",anger
"No-no, let me in!",anger
"Chandler, we have talked about this.",anger
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?,anger
I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.,anger
"That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!",anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger
Hey!,anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
Ross! Janice?!,anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.",anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger
We are not going to whistle.,anger
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!,anger
She keeps lying to me!,anger
It’s not the pants.,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
"All right, I'm outta here!",anger
I am not!,anger
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,anger
"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.",anger
She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!,anger
"Well,fall out of it.",anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!",anger
Y'know what? We need to move on.,anger
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
Right here!,anger
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin’ me?!",anger
You fell asleep!!,anger
"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?",anger
"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.",anger
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,anger
Big deal!,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
That’s it?!,anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
Get off!,anger
"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.",anger
You win.,anger
What kind of father do you think I am?,anger
Phoebe and Rachel!,anger
"I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley.",anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!",anger
"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",anger
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",anger
"Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!",anger
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.",anger
She broke my arm.,anger
Hi!,anger
"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.",anger
"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",anger
"Ross, no! There is",anger
I can’t believe you’re not picking me.,anger
I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,anger
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,anger
Count in our heads as-as good,anger
"A small puff of air, now come on!",anger
"A small puff of air, now come on!",anger
"All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!",anger
Fine!,anger
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,anger
Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.,anger
I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.,anger
"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",anger
No! You let go!,anger
I talk to you and nothin’.,anger
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",anger
"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",anger
Shh!,anger
That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
COME ON!!!!,anger
I can handle the stick!!,anger
I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!,anger
I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.,anger
You’re a mean old woman.,anger
Shh!,anger
"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",anger
"Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if",anger
"No, you started it.",anger
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",anger
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger
I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!,anger
"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",anger
Well then we’ll get wet.,anger
"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",anger
"Now, hold on!",anger
"We just broke up, first thing she does!",anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
Shut up! This place is a hole!,anger
Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.,anger
This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at.,anger
No! No! No!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",anger
I said I’ll do it!,anger
Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!,anger
No!,anger
"Ah, it’s says so in the script!",anger
"No, we’re not!!",anger
Me too.,anger
Big deal!,anger
What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!,anger
Yeah! Oh yes!,anger
Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
"Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!,anger
Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!,anger
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,anger
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,anger
Come on!,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
Thank you!,anger
Get out!!,anger
Rachel!,anger
"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",anger
"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too!",anger
"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.",anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
All the time!,anger
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",anger
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!,anger
I'm not jealous.,anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
A week?,anger
I always knew she liked him!,anger
"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!",anger
"Oh God, stop with the plan!",anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
Ahhh..,anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
You can't have it.,anger
"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",anger
Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.,anger
You did!,anger
A week?,anger
Fine!,anger
Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!,anger
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,anger
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
"Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",anger
I'll go in there.,anger
"Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",anger
I know. I’m mad at me too.,anger
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",anger
Hi!,anger
No!,anger
"Oh, boy, do they suck.",anger
Let’s go big bunny!,anger
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!,anger
"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.",anger
"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",anger
"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.",anger
"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone",anger
No!,anger
"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.",anger

"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",anger
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!,anger
"""I’m Monica.",anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
That’s my job!,anger
"No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?",anger
It was the ring!,anger
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about.,anger
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.,anger
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?,anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
Do you always have to bring him here?,anger
"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!",anger
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger
"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!   Thank you, thanks.",anger
"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!",anger
"Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",anger
Look at me!,anger
What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid,anger
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",anger
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?,anger
"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!",anger
It doesn’t say that in the script.,anger
"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",anger
I don’t have time for this.,anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
"Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",anger
Oh great! That,anger
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",anger
Do you always have to bring him here?,anger
"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",anger
This year was supposed to be great!,anger
"I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief.",anger
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,anger
"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",anger
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.,anger
"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",anger
Down at the docks again?,anger
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,anger
"She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!",anger
"Ok, are they listening?",anger
I got no sleep last night!,anger
Oh crap!,anger
"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",anger
"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",anger
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!,anger
"Now, hold on!",anger
"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",anger
Ross!,anger
So I have a flaw!,anger
I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,anger
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!",anger
Guys?,anger
"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",anger
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!,anger
Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!,anger
"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!",anger
You gotta take the canoe!,anger
"No, you started it.",anger
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.,anger
"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",anger
"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
Would you stop that!,anger
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,anger
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.,anger
"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!",anger
"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",anger
And we're not a couple of suckers!,anger
No! No! No! No——one can beat me.,anger
Guys?,anger
It just keeps getting worse and worse!,anger
"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",anger
Fine!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
"I know, that’s why I said again!",anger
Great.,anger
"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?",anger
She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!,anger
No!,anger
"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.",anger
No!,anger
Oh b-b-but it is!,anger
Get out!!,anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
No drinks near the bucket!,anger
"No, I’m gonna!!",anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",anger
"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
Would you stop that!,anger
Noo!,anger

"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.",anger
What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid,anger
Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!,anger
Do you always have to bring him here?,anger
See what you did.,anger
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger
"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",anger
Sing!!,anger
Why have you been following me?,anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger
Damnit Phoebe!!,anger
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!",anger
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.",anger
"No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.",anger
"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",anger
Look at you. All jealous.,anger
It creeps me out!,anger
"Well, she graduated from high school!",anger
"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!",anger
It was my quarter!,anger
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?,anger
"Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",anger
Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,anger
"Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,anger
I mean we should get free stuff too!,anger
"Please, what about you and Chandler?",anger
No!,anger
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!,anger
Count in our heads as-as good,anger
"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.",anger
We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half!,anger
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",anger
You don’t play the oboe!,anger
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?,anger
"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.",anger
Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move.,anger
It creeps me out!,anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",anger
Well we’ll see!,anger
I can’t believe you’re not picking me.,anger
"Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",anger
"I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",anger
I could play the oboe!,anger
"All right, I’m leaving!",anger
Phoebe!,anger
There was no kangaroo!,anger
"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",anger
Damnit!,anger
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",anger

Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .,anger
Guys?,anger
"Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",anger
"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said.",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
It creeps me out!,anger
Not nice enough.,anger
"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",anger
"I do not always have to be—okay, okay.",anger
"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!",anger
Gimme the this!,anger
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.,anger
"""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!""",anger
Great. So the ball is in his court?,anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!",anger
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!,anger
Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?,anger
He obviously went crazy.,anger
I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn!,anger
Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.,anger
"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
I don’t have time for this.,anger
Get out!,anger
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,anger
"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",anger

That almost hit me in the face.,anger
"What are you, insane?",anger
"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",anger
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.,anger
Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.,anger
But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,anger
Yuh-huh!,anger
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",anger
"When we make plans, I expect you to show up.",anger
What about me?! You-you just said I could!,anger
No I didn’t!,anger
All the time!,anger
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",anger
"No-no, let me in!",anger
Okay. But not about this!,anger
"Really, y’think so? I don’t..",anger
"""No we weren’t!""",anger

"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",anger
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!,anger
Noo!,anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
"So, just tell me the truth!",anger
"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do.""",anger
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger
And stop using my name!,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!",anger
"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",anger
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!,anger

No Phoebe I am mad!,anger
"Dude, this isn’t funny!",anger

"You look at me, and it’s nothin’.",anger
Aren't we a little old for this?,anger
"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",anger
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,anger
Would you stop?,anger
Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!,anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
"Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",anger
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
Oh crap!,anger
"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!""",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!,anger

Y'know what? We need to move on.,anger
Come on more!,anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger
"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",anger
I thought I told you to get outta here!,anger
It just keeps getting worse and worse!,anger
"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.",anger
My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.,anger
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.,anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.,anger
"Oh, I don't know, a million?",anger
He started it!,anger
We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!,anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.",anger
"And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?",anger
I don't have to give up the bag!,anger
You know what else I’m not gonna miss?,anger
I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment.,anger
"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!",anger
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger
"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",anger
"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am.",anger
"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",anger
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am,anger
"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",anger
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!",anger
Hi!,anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
Are you looking at her?!,anger
"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
Monica? Monica!,anger
Right?,anger
"Come on Phoebe, look at that!",anger
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.,anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.",anger
"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!",anger
I highly doubt that.,anger
And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!,anger
Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.,anger
Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!,anger
"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",anger
Yeah! Oh yes!,anger
Big deal!,anger
"Or, call an ambulance.",anger
"Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!",anger
"Ok, look! Enough is enough!",anger
"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?",anger
But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,anger
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!,anger
"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?",anger
I talk to you and nothin’.,anger
"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",anger
That’s you Rachel!,anger
"All right, that's it. I want both of you out.",anger
"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.",anger
Come on more!,anger
"Choose, you jackass!",anger
"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",anger
He cannot play at our wedding!,anger
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!,anger
"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",anger
"All right, that's it. I want both of you out.",anger
All you had to do was buy the card!,anger
"And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.",anger
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,anger
Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.,anger
Guys?,anger
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?",anger
All right?,anger
Cut me a real piece!,anger
Fine!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",anger
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",anger
It's not funny!,anger
Please!,anger
"Monica, leave him alone",anger
I can’t figure this out!,anger
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",anger
"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",anger
"Go little boy, go!",anger
"I'm like the bing, bing, bing.",anger
It’s not the pants.,anger
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!,anger
"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!",anger
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?,anger
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!,anger
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger
What woman?!,anger
You don’t play the oboe!,anger
Get out!,anger
And that they’re going to be drinking alot!,anger

"Well, he made a move on me.",anger
"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!",anger

"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",anger
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?,anger
"Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!",anger
Come on!,anger
"No, you started it.",anger
"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",anger
I really wish that you wouldn’t.,anger
Okay! When?!,anger
Do not speak ill of the dead.,anger
How could you not give me the message?,anger
You did!,anger
How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.,anger
"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",anger
Good choice.,anger
Can I tell you something? Me too.,anger
"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",anger
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,anger

I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",sadness

This is the worst Christmas ever.,sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
I can’t seem to say goodbye.,sadness
"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",sadness
"Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye!",sadness

How can I accept that...,sadness
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness

"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness

Shoot! We’re out of soda.,sadness
Yes that would have made more sense.,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness

I want him to have his uncle.,sadness
"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",sadness
"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.",sadness

Paolo made a pass at me.,sadness
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,sadness

"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.",sadness
Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!,sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
"I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.",sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
"And of course, the Indians.",sadness
Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,sadness
"Looks good, uh?",sadness
"It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",sadness
"Oh, I know.",sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
How can I accept that...,sadness
"Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.",sadness

Say you'll stay beside me,sadness
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness
This is hard.,sadness

"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.",sadness
"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",sadness
"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom.""",sadness
I know. I’m sorry.,sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness
"Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",sadness
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",sadness

The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!,sadness
Oh.,sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.,sadness
They-they have a liking problem with you.,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
Awww! Mel Torme died.,sadness

We’re not peeking?,sadness
"Ohh, that’s too bad!",sadness
Thanks.,sadness
"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
No!,sadness
Is this my fault?,sadness
"Y'know, for me anyway.",sadness
Well I was just so excited to see you.,sadness
"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",sadness
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,sadness
"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",sadness
"I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",sadness
"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",sadness
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",sadness
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.",sadness
"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",sadness
"No. No, you're not a loser.",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
Noo.,sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
"I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.",sadness
"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",sadness
No-no-no! We need something old!,sadness
Sorry.,sadness
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,sadness
Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.,sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?,sadness

You know? Forget it!,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?,sadness
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",sadness
"Looks good, uh?",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,sadness
I don’t want them to move to a,sadness
"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",sadness

"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.",sadness

My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness

It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,sadness
So I guess this is it.,sadness
"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",sadness
Yes that would have made more sense.,sadness
"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?",sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.",sadness

"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice",sadness
"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",sadness
"Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.",sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness
"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",sadness
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",sadness
She loves you!,sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
We’re not peeking?,sadness
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,sadness
"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",sadness
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,sadness
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,sadness
"Yeah, it was really hard.",sadness
"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom.""",sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness

"Aww, is it broken?",sadness
Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,sadness
"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",sadness

"All right, all right, you're right",sadness
"Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",sadness
"It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",sadness
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",sadness

"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call.",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",sadness
You think it looked amazing?,sadness

"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",sadness
"I’m sorry, I do that.",sadness
"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",sadness
I couldn’t do it.,sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call.",sadness
"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",sadness
Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working,sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.,sadness
"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",sadness
"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.",sadness
"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",sadness
"Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",sadness
She loves you!,sadness
"Ross, it's too hard.",sadness
"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",sadness
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",sadness
"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",sadness
Is it? Feels like two.,sadness
Hurry up.,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
I’m such a jerk.,sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
That was a pretty tough year.,sadness
"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before.",sadness

Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
"Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",sadness
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",sadness
Oh come on!!,sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
You still love me?,sadness
"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",sadness
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",sadness
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",sadness
Shoot! We’re out of soda.,sadness
It's my friends.,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
"Well, can you blame her?",sadness
What?!,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
Oh my God! Oh my God!!,sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness
Paolo made a pass at me.,sadness
"That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!",sadness
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,sadness
"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",sadness
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",sadness
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
"Oh, god help us.",sadness
"Oh, come on!",sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
What? I’m just said.,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
How can I accept that...,sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",sadness
That was a pretty tough year.,sadness
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,sadness
"So, uh, how's she doing?",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",sadness
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
Oh my God! Oh my God!!,sadness
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.",sadness
"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.",sadness
"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.",sadness
Thanks.,sadness
"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",sadness
"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!",sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,sadness
I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing.,sadness
"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?",sadness
Hey! It’s starting to snow.,sadness
"I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,sadness
How can I accept that...,sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
No.,sadness
"That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is!",sadness
"Ohh, okay, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",sadness
"Uh, hang out?! How long?",sadness
"In that, um, they don't.",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Forget that British chippy.""",sadness
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",sadness
"Ohh, ohh.",sadness
"Oh, I know.",sadness
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",sadness
"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",sadness
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",sadness
Who's gonna take me to the,sadness
"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",sadness
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",sadness
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,sadness
That’s kinda sad.,sadness
"No, because you’re not a grandmother!",sadness
Yes that would have made more sense.,sadness
"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",sadness
"By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.",sadness
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",sadness
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",sadness
Ugh,sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",sadness
"I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone.",sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
"Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true!",sadness
"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",sadness
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",sadness
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,sadness
There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
I know. I’m sorry.,sadness
I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!,sadness
I can't believe I'm hearing this!,sadness
Oh come on!!,sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,sadness
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",sadness
Hey! How’d it go?,sadness
"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",sadness
I can’t.,sadness
How can I accept that...,sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness
"Yeah, me too.",sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.",sadness
"Oh, I am so sorry.",sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",sadness
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,sadness
"Ohh, ohh.",sadness
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
"Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!",sadness
"Well, the old lady died.",sadness
"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",sadness
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.,sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.",sadness
"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?",sadness
"Um, and maybe I’m wrong!",sadness
Surprise,sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
What are you going to tell her?,sadness
"Uh, hang out?! How long?",sadness
"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...",sadness
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness
Where in Cuba?,sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",sadness
"Oh, I know.",sadness
"Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",sadness
"And of course, the Indians.",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
"Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.",sadness
"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.",sadness
Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.,sadness
"Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",sadness
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
"By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.",sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different.,sadness
"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t.",sadness
I can’t.,sadness
"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom.""",sadness
You had fantasies about Emily?,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",sadness
Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,sadness
But I made cards!!,sadness
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness

Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,sadness
"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness
"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",sadness
"You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.",sadness

"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
"I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",sadness
No...,sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
Shoot! We’re out of soda.,sadness
I have never known love like this.,sadness
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,sadness
"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
Yes that would have made more sense.,sadness
"Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",sadness
Not your name!,sadness
"Yeah. Well, umm.....",sadness
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,sadness
"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.",sadness
"Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.",sadness
It’s hard this whole platonic thing.,sadness
No!,sadness
"I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone.",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",sadness
Terry!,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness
Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.,sadness
I’m so-so sorry about yesterday.,sadness
"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",sadness
"Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",sadness
Hello? Who are we spying on?,sadness
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,sadness
"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",sadness

"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.",sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",sadness
"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",sadness
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",sadness
"Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.",sadness

"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.",sadness
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",sadness
Ross! Wait!,sadness
"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",sadness
It’s over.,sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.",sadness
You had fantasies about Emily?,sadness
I have never known love like this.,sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
No. Sorry man.,sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
You think it looked amazing?,sadness
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?,sadness
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
Is it? Feels like two.,sadness
"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",sadness
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",sadness
Hello? Who are we spying on?,sadness
"Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.",sadness
"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.",sadness
So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.,sadness
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,sadness
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,sadness
"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?",sadness
"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
I’m just doing it to get back at Ross.,sadness
"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",sadness
"I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",sadness
"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.",sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
"Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",sadness
Chris says they’re closing down the bar.,sadness
"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",sadness
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.,sadness
Does it bug you?,sadness
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
Oh yeah?,sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.",sadness
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,sadness
"Well, I lost.",sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
"In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry.",sadness

Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,sadness
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!,sadness
"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",sadness
"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.",sadness
"Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been    revoked again!",sadness
Oh.,sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is!",sadness
"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!",sadness
"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were",sadness
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",sadness
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
He's probably up in your room!,sadness
"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"All right, okay, well, apparently not!",sadness
"Seriously, how can you watch this?",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
Surprise,sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",sadness
I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing.,sadness
"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
Oh come on!!,sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness

"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.,sadness
"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",sadness
A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.,sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
"Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true!",sadness
Please!,sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",sadness
"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!",sadness
"Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!",sadness
"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.",sadness
"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"Oh, stop beating yourself up!",sadness
So like which of these two guys do you want to be?,sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,sadness
Got me.,sadness
"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from",sadness
"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t.",sadness
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,sadness
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,sadness
"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
Not your name!,sadness
"Fair, shmair",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
She loves you!,sadness
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!",sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
"Yeah, I’m fine.",sadness
You do attract some stinkers.,sadness
"It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",sadness
"All right, all right, you're right",sadness
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,sadness
I can’t.,sadness
There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
Is this my fault?,sadness
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",sadness
"Well, the old lady died.",sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?,sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
"No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",sadness
"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
"And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.",sadness
"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
"Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!",sadness
"Looks good, uh?",sadness
They've arrested Monica.,sadness
And did you?!,sadness
"That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is!",sadness
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",sadness
"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",sadness
This is hard.,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.",sadness
You would've liked it.,sadness
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?,sadness
"Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.",sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
No. Sorry man.,sadness
Is this my fault?,sadness
I have never known love like this.,sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
Yeah.,sadness
I have.,sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",sadness
It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different.,sadness
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",sadness
"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",sadness
"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",sadness
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,sadness
"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.,sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
My foot is stuck in the pocket.,sadness
I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.,sadness
"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!",sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
"Yeah, me too.",sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
I like a girl with a strong jaw.,sadness
What a baby.,sadness
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"All right. All right, I’ll do it.",sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
"By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.",sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,sadness
"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",sadness
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
"Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",sadness
Who's gonna take me to the,sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?,sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",sadness
"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.",sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do.,sadness
"No. No, you're not a loser.",sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,sadness
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
"That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.",sadness
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
You missed you’re chance!,sadness
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,sadness
"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.",sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
"Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
Estelle said I didn't get it.,sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
"Looks good, uh?",sadness
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",sadness
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
"Aw, don't do that",sadness
Manhattan does not have enough stores.,sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
"I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
"All right, all right, you're right",sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness
"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",sadness
"I know honey, I’m sorry.",sadness
Where in Cuba?,sadness
You can’t marry him!,sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",sadness
"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,sadness
"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",sadness
Estelle said I didn't get it.,sadness
"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.",sadness
"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.",sadness
"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",sadness
Sorry. Sorry.,sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
Yeah.,sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",sadness
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!,sadness
They've arrested Monica.,sadness
You had fantasies about Emily?,sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.",sadness
"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.",sadness
Oh.,sadness
What a baby.,sadness
You missed you’re chance!,sadness
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,sadness
I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.,sadness
"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",sadness
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",sadness
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness
"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.",sadness
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
"I, I can’t help you.",sadness
"No, I can’t get it out.",sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
Well we?re gonna miss you around here.,sadness
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,sadness
"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....",sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...",sadness
I-I’m really sorry.,sadness
What a baby.,sadness
"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness

"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.",sadness
"You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
"I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",sadness
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,sadness
Oh.,sadness
"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?,sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",sadness
"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
"No, I can’t get it out.",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
This is hard.,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
Noo.,sadness
"Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.",sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
Estelle said I didn't get it.,sadness
I can’t do it!,sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
"Don’t worry, I’m brave!",sadness
"Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",sadness
What disposable cameras?,sadness
Wanna play strip poker for practice?,sadness
"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?",sadness
"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",sadness
"No, I can’t get it out.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.,sadness
"Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.",sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness
I can’t.,sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
This is the worst Christmas ever.,sadness
You can’t marry him!,sadness
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,sadness
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",sadness
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",sadness
We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",sadness
"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,sadness
Forever.,sadness
"It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",sadness
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
Hello? Who are we spying on?,sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",sadness
"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",sadness
"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",sadness
"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.",sadness
Hurry up.,sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
Wait!,sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
No.,sadness
"Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.",sadness
"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.",sadness
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
"Ah yeah, sorry about that.",sadness
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
They-they have a liking problem with you.,sadness
Hey! How’d it go?,sadness
Got me.,sadness
"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",sadness
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",sadness
"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",sadness
"It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
Terry!,sadness
"It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",sadness
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",sadness
We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,sadness
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
I’m such a jerk.,sadness
Ramoray!,sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
Hey! How’d it go?,sadness
Say you'll stay beside me,sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"Yeah, me too.",sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",sadness
"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
I can’t do it!,sadness
It’s over.,sadness
Terry!,sadness
Uh-huh.  Good luck.,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",sadness
"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a",sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",sadness
"Yeah, it was really hard.",sadness
"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.",sadness
Oh God!,sadness
Oh.,sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness
"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",sadness
"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
I guess.,sadness
"Well, can you blame her?",sadness
Does it bug you?,sadness
"I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now.",sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",sadness
Manhattan does not have enough stores.,sadness
"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.",sadness
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,sadness
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",sadness
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",sadness
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",sadness
"Umm, she kissed me.",sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.",sadness
"Well, the old lady died.",sadness
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",sadness
"And I do, I have to make",sadness
"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom.""",sadness
"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",sadness
Wait!,sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,sadness
"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",sadness
"Your good heart Rach,  and, and....",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,sadness
"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",sadness
"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",sadness
"Oh, stop beating yourself up!",sadness
Wait!,sadness
Manhattan does not have enough stores.,sadness
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,sadness
"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",sadness
Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.,sadness
Total wuss!,sadness
"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.,sadness
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness

"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"Forget that British chippy.""",sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
But I made cards!!,sadness
"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness

"I know honey, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness

"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.",sadness
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",sadness
There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,sadness

"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before.",sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",sadness
"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",sadness
"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",sadness
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.,sadness
"I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",sadness
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness

He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",sadness
Terry!,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
That was a pretty tough year.,sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
I don’t want to lose you.,sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
I don’t want to lose you.,sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
I don’t want to lose you.,sadness
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,sadness
"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.,sadness
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",sadness
"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",sadness
Oh God!,sadness
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness

I have never known love like this.,sadness
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",sadness
"Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",sadness
"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.",sadness
"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
What?,sadness
It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,sadness
"Well, I lost.",sadness
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,sadness
What a baby.,sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working,sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.",sadness
I guess.,sadness
"And I do, I have to make",sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
"Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
Wait!,sadness
"I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",sadness
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.",sadness
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",sadness
So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
I can’t seem to say goodbye.,sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,sadness
"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...",sadness
"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
"Oh, be-because of the leather pants.",sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
Bob!,sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
"No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",sadness
Paper cut!,sadness
"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now",sadness
Oh.,sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness

"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
No...,sadness
"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",sadness
"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",sadness
"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?",sadness
I want him to have his uncle.,sadness
"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",sadness
"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",sadness
"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",sadness
"Sorry, Pheebs.",sadness
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?,sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
Aw! Does that mean the,sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
Thanks.,sadness
"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Um, and maybe I’m wrong!",sadness
"Ross, it's too hard.",sadness
"Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.",sadness
"No me, I am so sorry...",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",sadness
"Yeah, I’m fine.",sadness
"Oh, come on!",sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!",sadness
Surprise,sadness
"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.",sadness
"Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",sadness
"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.,sadness
"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?",sadness
"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.",sadness
"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
I can’t.,sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",sadness
Wait!,sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
Well we?re gonna miss you around here.,sadness
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,sadness
"All right, I’m-I’m not English.",sadness
"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.,sadness
"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!",sadness
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.,sadness
Paper cut!,sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",sadness
"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were",sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!,sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
But I made cards!!,sadness
"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",sadness
"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.",sadness
"Oh, I know.",sadness
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",sadness
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!",sadness
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",sadness
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,sadness
"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",sadness
We’re probably too old to do that now.,sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.",sadness
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!,sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental.",sadness
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",sadness
"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.",sadness
"Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.",sadness
You do attract some stinkers.,sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,sadness
Ugh,sadness
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness
Wait!,sadness
"Yeah, it was really hard.",sadness
"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",sadness
Wanna play strip poker for practice?,sadness
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",sadness
"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",sadness
"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.",sadness
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,sadness
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",sadness
"That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge",sadness
"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",sadness
"I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",sadness
"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",sadness
Say you'll stay beside me,sadness

Is this my fault?,sadness
"Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.",sadness
"Y'know, for me anyway.",sadness
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",sadness
Noo.,sadness
"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!",sadness
"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,sadness
I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks.,sadness
"I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.",sadness
I can’t seem to say goodbye.,sadness
This is the worst Christmas ever.,sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",sadness
"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",sadness
"Yeah, I’m fine.",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
Hey! How’d it go?,sadness
"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",sadness
"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",sadness
"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",sadness
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me.",sadness
"I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",sadness
Chris says they’re closing down the bar.,sadness

"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",sadness
Yeah but,sadness

"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.",sadness
Oh.,sadness
Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.,sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"Fair, shmair",sadness

"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness

"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",sadness
"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.",sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,sadness
"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",sadness
"Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",sadness
"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",sadness
"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section",sadness
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
We’re probably too old to do that now.,sadness
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",sadness
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,sadness
"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
Because he’s in love with the British chippy!,sadness
"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",sadness
"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...",sadness
Sorry. Sorry.,sadness
Paper cut!,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",sadness
"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",sadness
"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",sadness
Please!,sadness
I didn’t get the annulment.,sadness
"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.",sadness
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.,sadness
I can’t do it!,sadness
"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",sadness
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",sadness
"Oh, come on!",sadness
So like which of these two guys do you want to be?,sadness
"Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
Is it something I’m putting out there?,sadness
"Oh, stop beating yourself up!",sadness
You know? Forget it!,sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.,sadness
"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",sadness
"Uh, hang out?! How long?",sadness
"Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness

Sorry.,sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
No!,sadness
"Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",sadness
Sorry. Wrong boobies.,sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
Is it? Feels like two.,sadness
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",sadness
"You uh, you may have been right about Jill.",sadness
You missed you’re chance!,sadness
"All right, okay, well, apparently not!",sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
"In that, um, they don't.",sadness
"Yeah. Well, umm.....",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,sadness
I-I’m really sorry.,sadness
"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,sadness
But I made cards!!,sadness
I want him to have his uncle.,sadness
"I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.",sadness
"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",sadness
"Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.",sadness
"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",sadness
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,sadness
"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
Don’t go!,sadness
"Umm, she kissed me.",sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",sadness
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
"Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
"In that, um, they don't.",sadness
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",sadness
Is it something I’m putting out there?,sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",sadness
"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,sadness
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",sadness
I’m so-so sorry about yesterday.,sadness
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
I want him to have his uncle.,sadness
I didn’t get the annulment.,sadness
"And I do, I have to make",sadness
"Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
I can’t seem to say goodbye.,sadness
"Well, I lost.",sadness
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
"Seriously, how can you watch this?",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
Sorry.,sadness
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
"Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
Ross! Wait!,sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
No-no-no! We need something old!,sadness
Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,sadness
I’m sorry daddy.,sadness
"Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",sadness
Paper cut!,sadness
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"Barry, I'm sorry...",sadness
"That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!",sadness
"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",sadness
"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",sadness
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.,sadness
"I, I can’t help you.",sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.,sadness
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
"Ohh, ohh.",sadness
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",sadness
"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness
Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.,sadness
"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",sadness
Yes that would have made more sense.,sadness
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",sadness
"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",sadness
Does it bug you?,sadness
"Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?",sadness
Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break.,sadness
We’re probably too old to do that now.,sadness
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,sadness
That's stealing!,sadness
They've arrested Monica.,sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
"All right, I’m-I’m not English.",sadness
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
It’s over.,sadness
"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?",sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",sadness
Oh come on!!,sadness
"I know honey, I’m sorry.",sadness
"I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now.",sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!,sadness
"In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry.",sadness
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness
No-no it’s not!,sadness
Ramoray!,sadness
"You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
Sorry.,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.",sadness
I can’t believe this!,sadness
"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!",sadness
"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",sadness
"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",sadness
"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.",sadness
"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.",sadness
"It’s just changed, everything.",sadness
I didn’t get the annulment.,sadness
I can’t do this.,sadness
"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",sadness
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",sadness
"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.",sadness
"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",sadness
Sorry.,sadness
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.,sadness
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.",sadness
Oh God!,sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.",sadness
"All right, okay, well, apparently not!",sadness
"No me, I am so sorry...",sadness
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,sadness
"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",sadness
"I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
"Well yeah, I lied before.",sadness
So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
I know. I’m sorry.,sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",sadness
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",sadness
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness
"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.",sadness
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
All the time?,sadness
"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?",sadness
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",sadness
"I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now.",sadness
Hey! It’s starting to snow.,sadness
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",sadness
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!,sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
No.,sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",sadness
"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.",sadness
"I am so, so, so, so sorry!",sadness
"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.,sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
I’m so sorry!,sadness
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,sadness
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.",sadness
Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.,sadness
What?,sadness
It's my friends.,sadness
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?",sadness
Manhattan does not have enough stores.,sadness
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",sadness
Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,sadness
We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness
Sorry. Sorry.,sadness
"No me, I am so sorry...",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",sadness
They-they have a liking problem with you.,sadness
"Y'know, for me anyway.",sadness
I know. I’m sorry.,sadness
"Uh, hang out?! How long?",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.,sadness
"Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
"Sorry, Pheebs.",sadness
"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman    show tonight.",sadness
"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",sadness
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",sadness
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",sadness
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,sadness
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,sadness
"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"No, I can’t get it out.",sadness
"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
"Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.",sadness
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"All right, I’m-I’m not English.",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.,sadness
"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",sadness
"In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
"Ooh, I miss dating.",sadness
"Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.",sadness
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.,sadness
"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",sadness
"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?",sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",sadness
"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",sadness
Right here!,sadness
"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.",sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
"Ohh, that’s too bad!",sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
"Oh, be-because of the leather pants.",sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
She loves you!,sadness
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.,sadness
"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",sadness
"All right, okay, well, apparently not!",sadness
"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
"Please, help me out, for old times sake.",sadness
You can’t marry him!,sadness
Terry!,sadness
"You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.,sadness
"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,sadness
"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",sadness
"Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",sadness
Do I Rach?,sadness
"How-how are you, Mom?",sadness
"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",sadness
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
"Well, it's official there are no good movies.",sadness
"Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience.",sadness
Surprise,sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.",sadness
"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",sadness
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
"Well, I lost.",sadness

We can't. We're not pharmacists!,sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness

"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.",sadness
"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",sadness

"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",sadness
"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",sadness
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,sadness

Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,sadness
I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing.,sadness
We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness

There’s one thing missing.,sadness
Ross! Wait!,sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,sadness
"All right, all right, you're right",sadness
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.,sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
Terry!,sadness
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",sadness
I kinda feel like it's my fault.,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
Is it? Feels like two.,sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
"I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.",sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!,sadness
"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.",sadness
It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.,sadness
Yeah but,sadness
"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",sadness
"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.",sadness
"Aww, is it broken?",sadness
Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.,sadness
"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
I don't wanna give up the bag.,sadness
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,sadness
Estelle said I didn't get it.,sadness
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,sadness
It's my friends.,sadness
"Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!",sadness
Monica!,sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.",sadness
"Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.",sadness
Shoot! We’re out of soda.,sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
Sorry.,sadness
"I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",sadness
"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.",sadness
This is the worst Christmas ever.,sadness
The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do.,sadness
"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",sadness
"Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
Terry already hired that girl over there.,sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness
"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness
"That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge",sadness
So like which of these two guys do you want to be?,sadness
"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
My wife’s a lesbian.,sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"Ooh, I miss dating.",sadness
Here we go again.,sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?,sadness
"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",sadness
"Yeah, I’m fine.",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",sadness
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,sadness
Well I was just so excited to see you.,sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness
"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"Oh, stop beating yourself up!",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"Sorry, Pheebs.",sadness
Paper cut!,sadness
"Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?",sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.,sadness
"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",sadness
"No me, I am so sorry...",sadness
That’s kinda sad.,sadness
"Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.",sadness
"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t.",sadness
"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",sadness
Say you'll stay beside me,sadness
"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
Right here!,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
Oh.,sadness
Please!,sadness
"Sorry, Pheebs.",sadness
"Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",sadness
"Well yeah, I lied before.",sadness
Terry!,sadness
But I made cards!!,sadness
"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",sadness
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness
"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.",sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a,sadness
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
"Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.",sadness
"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",sadness
"Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",sadness
"It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",sadness
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,sadness
"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",sadness
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
Where in Cuba?,sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
Monica!,sadness
There’s one thing missing.,sadness
Is this because of the burrito thing?,sadness
"I’m sorry, I do that.",sadness
"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",sadness
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.,sadness
"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",sadness
"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.",sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.",sadness
She's forbidden fruit!,sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",sadness
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",sadness
Wait!,sadness
"Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",sadness
Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,sadness
"I don't know...right, he's the pig!",sadness
Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,sadness
Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness
There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,sadness
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness
"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",sadness
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!,sadness
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",sadness
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",sadness
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",sadness
What?,sadness
"That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is!",sadness
You do attract some stinkers.,sadness
"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
This is hard.,sadness
"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",sadness
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",sadness
It’s over.,sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,sadness
"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?",sadness
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!",sadness
"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it.",sadness
It’s hard this whole platonic thing.,sadness
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
Uh-huh.  Good luck.,sadness
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!,sadness
You think it looked amazing?,sadness
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,sadness
"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.",sadness
"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other.",sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"No. No, you're not a loser.",sadness
"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness
You still love me?,sadness
They-they have a liking problem with you.,sadness
"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section",sadness
No. Sorry man.,sadness
My foot is stuck in the pocket.,sadness
I can’t.,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
I can’t do this.,sadness
Estelle said I didn't get it.,sadness
She loves you!,sadness
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,sadness
And did you?!,sadness

"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!",sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
Paolo made a pass at me.,sadness
"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.",sadness
It’s so hard!,sadness
"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.",sadness
I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.,sadness
"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",sadness
"No me, I am so sorry...",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness
"Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",sadness
"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.",sadness
"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.",sadness
I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.,sadness
I couldn’t do it.,sadness
What disposable cameras?,sadness
"Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.",sadness
"She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone.",sadness
Wait!,sadness
"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",sadness
"Yes, while I was in the chair!",sadness
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,sadness
"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",sadness
I don’t want to lose you.,sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",sadness
I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses!,sadness
"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",sadness
I guess.,sadness
"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",sadness
No-no-no! We need something old!,sadness
"Uh, hang out?! How long?",sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.",sadness
I can’t.,sadness
What disposable cameras?,sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",sadness
What?!,sadness
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,sadness
"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.",sadness
I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.,sadness
"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?",sadness
"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",sadness
"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",sadness
"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.,sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
Wait!,sadness
Please!,sadness
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?,sadness
"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.",sadness
"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness

"Oh, you have been through so much.",sadness
Please!,sadness
"All right, all right, you're right",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",sadness
"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",sadness
"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.",sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?",sadness
I want him to have his uncle.,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness

"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",sadness
"Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.",sadness
Uh Phoebe?,sadness
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?,sadness
"She knows, and she won’t tell me.",sadness
"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness

"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
Does it still hurt?,sadness
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?,sadness
What? I’m just said.,sadness
"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?",sadness
"Y'know, for me anyway.",sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?",sadness
Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.,sadness
"Oh, come on!",sadness

"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",sadness
Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?,sadness
"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.",sadness
"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?",sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.,sadness
Where in Cuba?,sadness
I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.,sadness
You would've liked it.,sadness

And did you?!,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
"Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",sadness

"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",sadness
"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",sadness
Hey! How’d it go?,sadness
"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.",sadness
"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from",sadness
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?,sadness

So I really never get to win anymore?,sadness
I’m sorry daddy.,sadness

"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division.",sadness
"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",sadness
Is it something I’m putting out there?,sadness
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",sadness
I couldn’t do it.,sadness
Chris says they’re closing down the bar.,sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness

Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness
"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,sadness
"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?",sadness

"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness

We’re never gonna find anybody.,sadness
Will you hurry up?,sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.",sadness

You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.,sadness
"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",sadness
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,sadness
Is it something I’m putting out there?,sadness
That’s not how that was supposed to come out.,sadness
"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this.",sadness
"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",sadness
"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",sadness

"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",sadness
"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t....",sadness
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,sadness
You can’t marry him!,sadness
He's probably up in your room!,sadness
Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.,sadness
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",sadness
He's probably up in your room!,sadness
"Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.",sadness
"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call.",sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness

"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
"Ahh, no.",sadness
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,sadness
"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
I have.,sadness
You know? Forget it!,sadness
How can I accept that...,sadness
"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.",sadness
You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.,sadness

"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.",sadness
Oh.,sadness
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness
"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",sadness
You have no idea how much I need this.,sadness

"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section",sadness
I’m so sorry!,sadness
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",sadness

"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness
"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",sadness
"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",sadness
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",sadness
"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",sadness
Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.,sadness
No-no-no! We need something old!,sadness

Do I Rach?,sadness
"Come on sweetie! You?ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.,sadness
"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",sadness
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.,sadness
"No, no, it’s just my tooth.",sadness
"Oh, I know.",sadness
"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.",sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness

Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?,sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness

"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things.",sadness
"Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.",sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
Is this my fault?,sadness
"So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  but the rest of us have a",sadness
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.,sadness
"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",sadness
"I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",sadness
Who's gonna take me to the,sadness
"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",sadness
It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,sadness
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",sadness
"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",sadness
"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",sadness

"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",sadness
"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship",sadness
"Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?",sadness
"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",sadness
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,sadness
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",sadness
We ruined everything.,sadness
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,sadness
Wait!,sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!,sadness
"Ross, it's too hard.",sadness
"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",sadness
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",sadness
"Well, can you blame her?",sadness
"That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that.",sadness
I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.,sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
"I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.",sadness
"That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is!",sadness
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",sadness
What a baby.,sadness
Wait a minute!,sadness
Wanna play strip poker for practice?,sadness
"Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.",sadness
No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!,sadness
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,sadness
"Yeah, me too.",sadness
"Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.",sadness
"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
Thanks.,sadness

"Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye!",sadness
"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.",sadness
Okay well that’s good to know.,sadness

"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness
"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",sadness
"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",sadness
Uh Phoebe?,sadness
I don’t think this number’s right!,sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
I can’t.,sadness
"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.",sadness
I don’t want to lose you.,sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
"Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.",sadness
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.,sadness
"One more chance Ursula, please?",sadness
"Seriously, how can you watch this?",sadness
"Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.",sadness
"Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",sadness
"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",sadness
I can’t do this.,sadness
"I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.",sadness
"Oh please, they're having sex.",sadness
"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",sadness
Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.,sadness
Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.,sadness
"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section",sadness
"All right, okay, well, apparently not!",sadness
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness
I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks.,sadness
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.,sadness
"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine.",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.,sadness
"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.",sadness
"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.",sadness
I have never known love like this.,sadness
Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.,sadness
Yeah.,sadness
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,sadness
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",sadness
"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",sadness
"Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!",sadness
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!,sadness
"Okay, I’m sorry.",sadness
"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!",sadness
Yeah but,sadness
"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",sadness
She loves you!,sadness
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,sadness
"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.",sadness
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
"Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",sadness
"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.",sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",sadness
Forever.,sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.",sadness
Terry!,sadness

"Ohh, God.",sadness
"Oh, stop beating yourself up!",sadness
"I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.",sadness
"Ohh, ohh.",sadness

"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
I couldn’t do it.,sadness
"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.",sadness
"Ohh, God.",sadness
"You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",sadness
"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!",sadness
"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.",sadness
Sorry.,sadness

"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",sadness
"I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.",sadness
No!,sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",sadness
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!",sadness
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.,sadness
"It’s just changed, everything.",sadness
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!,sadness
I’m sorry.,sadness
"Obviously, I screwed up.",sadness
So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.,sadness
We can't. We're not pharmacists!,sadness
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",sadness
You guys are killing me!,sadness
"I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",sadness
What are you going to tell her?,sadness

"She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.",sadness

I can't believe I'm hearing this!,sadness

"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness
"Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...",sadness
"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?",sadness
I’m the ruptured spleen.,sadness
"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.",sadness
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",sadness

I can’t do it!,sadness
"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.",sadness
"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",sadness
Or Friday with no two pizzas!,sadness

"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.",sadness
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,sadness

You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!,sadness
"Sorry, Pheebs.",sadness
"Look, is there something wrong with me?",sadness
"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…""",sadness
"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.",sadness

"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",sadness
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",sadness
We’re probably too old to do that now.,sadness
"Look, I just lost my other job.",sadness
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.,sadness
"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",sadness
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,sadness
"Aww, is it broken?",sadness
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",sadness

I like a girl with a strong jaw.,sadness
"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",sadness
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness

"So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.",neutral
"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.",neutral
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,neutral

"Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.",neutral
Good!,neutral

"Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it",neutral
And people say you don’t pay attention.,neutral
Fight’s over!,neutral
The ride broke down.,neutral
"Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things.",neutral
"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",neutral
"Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?",neutral

"Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?",neutral
That-that’s a no.,neutral
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.,neutral
"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.""",neutral
"Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",neutral
"So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.",neutral
"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.",neutral
No. Why?,neutral
"That was so awkward, we were really nervous.",neutral
"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",neutral

The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,neutral
This is about us.,neutral
"So uh, how you doin’?",neutral

"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.",neutral
"Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?",neutral
Hey.,neutral

"Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop.",neutral
Enh. Sure!,neutral
"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.",neutral
Here’s your call sheet for tomorrow.,neutral

"Yeah, it’s the new building on Avenue A.",neutral
Hey.,neutral

"Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.",neutral
"Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",neutral
"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",neutral
‘Kay!,neutral

"Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'",neutral
Or an uncle...,neutral
Well that’s ambitious.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.",neutral
No.,neutral

"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",neutral
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!,neutral
What a sweet story.,neutral
"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",neutral
Which one do you think she is?,neutral
"Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.",neutral

I’ll be there.,neutral
"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.",neutral
"I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",neutral

"Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!",neutral
"Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.",neutral
Oh but you could.,neutral
Yeah! Look!,neutral
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.,neutral

Mm-Hm,neutral
"Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.",neutral
"No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.",neutral
"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal.",neutral

"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know.",neutral
"So, so, what’d ya think?",neutral

"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.",neutral
"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.",neutral
Pretty much.,neutral
"Phoebe, what is it?",neutral
Basically we just feel that he's...,neutral
Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us.,neutral
"All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?",neutral
"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,",neutral
That's all right.,neutral
Hey P,neutral
"Hey, did you pick a roommate?",neutral

"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.",neutral
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",neutral
"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",neutral
"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",neutral
"Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes",neutral

"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.",neutral
"What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!",neutral

That saves us a conversation.,neutral
He's planning your birthday party.,neutral
"Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",neutral
It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.,neutral
"I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.",neutral
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,neutral
About a half an hour.,neutral
"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?",neutral
"Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?",neutral
"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",neutral

You pick one.,neutral
Nice to meet you too.,neutral
Let’s go watch it at your place.,neutral
"Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.",neutral
"Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.",neutral
Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!,neutral
"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.",neutral
"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.",neutral

"Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.",neutral

There’s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little…erotica.,neutral
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.,neutral
Relax. It’s just Issac’s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.,neutral

You want some help with that?,neutral
"Yeah, no they don’t do that.",neutral
With what?,neutral
That’s it.,neutral

"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?",neutral
Shh.,neutral
"Ross, you gotta follow your heart.",neutral
"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",neutral
Maybe we should check the trash chute.,neutral
"All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",neutral
"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.",neutral
"Here, I'll get it.",neutral
"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",neutral
"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",neutral

Never had that dream.,neutral
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,neutral

Okay.,neutral
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.,neutral
"Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.",neutral
Can you just hold on for one minute?,neutral

"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",neutral
But what about how much taller he is than me?,neutral
"All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral

"So, what are we gonna do today?",neutral
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?,neutral
Steady.,neutral
I don’t know.  Me neither.,neutral
All right.,neutral
Just smile and don’t talk to,neutral
"Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.",neutral

Okay.,neutral
"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.",neutral
How about you?,neutral
"I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.",neutral
Hi Phoebe.,neutral
And people say you don’t pay attention.,neutral
"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",neutral
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?,neutral

"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?",neutral
What you don’t think I’d go up to her?,neutral
"No. Joey, she",neutral
"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.",neutral
Phoebe?,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Dad, that won’t matter to her.",neutral
"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",neutral
All right where’s that turkey!,neutral
"All right, gimme your foot.",neutral
"So, have you kids eaten yet?",neutral
Pick one.,neutral
"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.",neutral
Come on.,neutral
It doesn't matter who knows what.,neutral
I’m not freaking out.,neutral

Why not?,neutral
"Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.",neutral
"Well ah, ........y'know.",neutral
"Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?",neutral
"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?",neutral
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,neutral
"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?",neutral
Light still out?,neutral
"But, we are.",neutral
"Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",neutral
"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",neutral
"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so",neutral
"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",neutral
"Oh, I should go, too.",neutral
PBS Telethon.,neutral

Good-bye.,neutral
"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",neutral
Alright?,neutral
"I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.",neutral
"First of all, it's on your ass.",neutral
"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",neutral
"No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.",neutral
She-she thinks that you’re just using me.,neutral
"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, let’s skedaddle.",neutral
"Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",neutral
"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.",neutral
"I know Mona, just hear me out.",neutral
"No, Chandler.",neutral
"Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.",neutral
Is that all?,neutral
"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!",neutral
"Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final.",neutral
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.,neutral
How do I look?,neutral
"Okay, who’s next?!",neutral
I asked him.,neutral
"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",neutral
"Okay, listen Robert...",neutral
"It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?",neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"Of course, of course.",neutral
All right.,neutral
I’d better get back to my desk.,neutral
"I, um...",neutral
"All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do.",neutral
"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.",neutral
"Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.",neutral
I guess I'm done.,neutral
"Yeah, listen...",neutral
I have to be up in seven minutes.,neutral
"Nothing, why?",neutral
This is a hospital.,neutral

Okay. This stuff?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Uhh,",neutral
How are you feeling?,neutral
"Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels",neutral
"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",neutral
"No Cobb, as in cobb salad.",neutral
"I mean really, think about it.",neutral
"But I'll still always come back, like this.",neutral
Yeah!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels",neutral

I didn't get it?,neutral
"Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery.",neutral
So.,neutral

"Yeah, that’s her.",neutral
"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!",neutral
"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.",neutral
I found a dried up seashores.,neutral
And Monica knows...,neutral
"Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.",neutral
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,neutral
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,neutral
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.,neutral
Kate Miller it is.,neutral
Feminist issue. That's where I went!,neutral
"Yeah, they still wear underwear.",neutral

"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",neutral
I broke up with her.,neutral
Well do you love him?,neutral
"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.",neutral
"We don’t, really.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Oh right, right.",neutral
"""Benefits lapsed.""",neutral
Well,neutral
"Well, I’m not gonna talk because",neutral
"No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.",neutral
"It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at",neutral
Bloomingdale’s,neutral
"Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.",neutral
"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",neutral
"Hey, Joe.",neutral

"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.",neutral
"Oh, I got that for him.",neutral
You're our third call tonight.,neutral
Crew guy.,neutral
Hey guys!,neutral
"If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.",neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.,neutral
Me neither.,neutral
Hey,neutral
Ross.,neutral
Did you make your deposit?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
"If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.",neutral
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.,neutral
It’s very not good leaving candles unattended.,neutral
"Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",neutral
Otherwise it's just cruel.,neutral
All right.,neutral
"Umm, okay, okay, look.",neutral
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",neutral
"Oh, Rachel.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Ready, Annabelle?",neutral
"All right, I'll see you guys later.",neutral
What if I asked?,neutral
Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,neutral
"Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",neutral
I bet it’s fast.,neutral
Do you have a plan?,neutral
"Oh, that must be it.",neutral
"Joey, this is",neutral
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.,neutral
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,neutral
And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.,neutral
I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast.,neutral
"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Why not?,neutral
"Hey you guys, guess what?",neutral
That sounds fair.,neutral
He says he was too.,neutral
"Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",neutral
"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",neutral
Joe.,neutral
"Oh, right, OK. Ole.",neutral
"Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.",neutral
"Well, I didn’t realize until I got home.",neutral
"I mean, we're scientists, right?",neutral
Sure?,neutral
Ross?,neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
So are guys doing okay?,neutral
"Hey, how'd it go?",neutral
"Actually, that can't happen.",neutral
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.,neutral
"Ooh, very official.",neutral
"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.",neutral
"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.",neutral
"But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed.",neutral
"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.",neutral
"Listen, can you do me a favor?",neutral
"Thanks, bye.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Deep Impact,neutral
"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else?",neutral
"Ummmmmmmm, no.",neutral
"Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?",neutral
"Yes, please.",neutral
"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.",neutral
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.,neutral
I can promise not to tell her again.,neutral
"Oh, ah- the kid has it.",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",neutral
"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal.",neutral
Ameri-ccan.,neutral
"Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!",neutral
"Where do you think,  Zelda?",neutral
"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",neutral
Who is Maria?,neutral
You bet.  Maybe some other time?,neutral
"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",neutral
"Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick.",neutral
Are you under the sheet?,neutral
"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!",neutral
"Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s",neutral
The Armadillo was actually not so,neutral
"No, I really did forget my purse.",neutral
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.,neutral
"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",neutral
"Do I? Thank you, so do you.",neutral
"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Like your sweater.,neutral
"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.",neutral
"No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",neutral
William Sonoma,neutral
Just ignore them.,neutral
"Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it",neutral
"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it.",neutral
See ya then.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",neutral
Which you just gave up really quickly.,neutral
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.,neutral
What do ya say? What do ya say?,neutral
"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...",neutral
Maybe you can tell me.,neutral
"No, I don’t think so.",neutral
I’ll be waiting.,neutral
"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",neutral
"Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",neutral
You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you,neutral
"Okay, now much have you won so far?",neutral
"But, we’ll stay here with you.",neutral
"And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",neutral
"This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing",neutral
What are you up too?,neutral
The British are coming?,neutral
Careful of the angle.,neutral
"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",neutral
"I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.",neutral
Come on.,neutral
The fear of,neutral

"Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",neutral
Where have you been?,neutral
"Okay, you’re fine.",neutral
"That’s very good, what’s your name?",neutral

"Yeah, they’re out of town.",neutral
"I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.",neutral

"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?",neutral
"I, I don’t know.",neutral
"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.",neutral
Who?,neutral
"Oh, that’s better then.",neutral
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Okay, Chandler!",neutral
"Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.",neutral
The first good thing she gets me in weeks.,neutral
"How about a hammer, or a small blade?",neutral
"Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.",neutral
"Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys",neutral
But we really do need to find someone up here.,neutral
She might be able to do better.,neutral

"I know Mona, just hear me out.",neutral
"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.",neutral
"Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.",neutral
Relax. It’s just Issac’s D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.,neutral
Come on.,neutral
"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",neutral
‘Kay.,neutral
"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.",neutral
I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.,neutral
"Almost! But first, we gotta start.",neutral
Haul ass!!!,neutral
...Joe.,neutral
"Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...",neutral

"Well, this has been fun.",neutral
"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",neutral
I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.,neutral
Mine?  Right here?,neutral
"Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.",neutral
We'll give you Janice.,neutral
"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.",neutral

I’ve got canned goods.,neutral
"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.",neutral
You're right.,neutral
"Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?",neutral

"Joey, how do you make",neutral
"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.",neutral
"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",neutral
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,neutral

Okay.,neutral
"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.",neutral
That my friend is D-Cup.,neutral
"Ben, you ready?",neutral

Okay!,neutral
"All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",neutral
I mean what’s more important?,neutral

"Lights.  Uh, romantic lights.",neutral
"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.",neutral

"All right, bye-bye.",neutral
And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.,neutral

"I mean, that’s got to come in handy",neutral
Hi!,neutral
"Oh, I got that for him.",neutral
"So Pheebs, what is the book about?",neutral
Maybe?,neutral
"Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?",neutral
"Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.",neutral
"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",neutral
In,neutral
"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",neutral
"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.",neutral
Am I interrupting?,neutral
Ahh!,neutral
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.,neutral
"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.",neutral
"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",neutral
No it's not.,neutral
"Joey, where are the",neutral
"So, does this  come in another color or",neutral
"What people think or how you feel, huh?",neutral
"Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.",neutral
These got left for ya.,neutral
"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?",neutral
"Oh you did, there are twenty in here.",neutral
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.,neutral
Sit down.,neutral
Where's Chandler?,neutral
No.  This is my red sweater.,neutral
"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",neutral
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.,neutral
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.,neutral
"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.",neutral
I know.,neutral
"Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",neutral
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.,neutral
"I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.",neutral
"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",neutral
Absolutely.,neutral
I'm going into business people.,neutral
-leg?,neutral
I think I left a donut up here.,neutral
"I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",neutral
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"I, I don’t know.",neutral
Otherwise it's just cruel.,neutral
"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.",neutral
"And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",neutral
"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.",neutral
We don’t care about where we stay.,neutral
"All right that’s it, school is in session!",neutral
Good bye!,neutral
Alright?,neutral
"Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on.",neutral
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8",neutral
"Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.",neutral
"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",neutral
"Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.",neutral
Nope.,neutral
"Okay, so he's out of here.",neutral
I dropped a cup.,neutral
"No, one of them...",neutral
I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,neutral
"Hello sir, you know Monica.",neutral
He was my first client when I became a party planner.,neutral
Y'know?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
When will that be?,neutral
Oh that.,neutral
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.,neutral
Is there a problem?,neutral
What were you doing?,neutral
Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.,neutral
"Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm",neutral
"Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.",neutral
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral
Who?,neutral
Thanks a lot.,neutral
It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity.,neutral
"Ah, just one other thing.",neutral
"There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",neutral
"Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.",neutral
Do you want a date Saturday?,neutral
Is that so?,neutral
Ross.,neutral
"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",neutral
You didn’t just break up.,neutral
What was it for?,neutral
Hey! I,neutral
"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.",neutral
Come on.,neutral
"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.",neutral
Monica.,neutral
"For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around.",neutral
It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a,neutral
I think you're better than you think you are.,neutral
Because the kids need new shoes.,neutral
"Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget.",neutral
"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.",neutral
Oh. Well then shut me up.,neutral
He may think I’m sick.,neutral
Electrical plans for the building.,neutral
"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.",neutral
"Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.",neutral
I came to give you this  and this.,neutral
"All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?",neutral
"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",neutral
Looks like a fun gang.,neutral
"No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.",neutral
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",neutral
"Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century.",neutral
There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?,neutral
No.,neutral
"Well, there's this one thing… Okay,  here goes.",neutral
"Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",neutral
That—this milk is mine.,neutral
"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.",neutral
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.,neutral
"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.",neutral
"Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window  Thread the needle.",neutral
"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?",neutral
"Phoebe, we’re getting",neutral
"Oh, listen.",neutral
And why do you care so much?,neutral
"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",neutral
"I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.",neutral
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.,neutral
I don’t think you have much choice.,neutral
Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.,neutral
"Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...,neutral
"Ross, you remember Susan.",neutral
These people'll scooch down.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.",neutral
Why is Ross doing that?,neutral
Absolutely.  You can relax,neutral
"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",neutral
"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",neutral
Why?,neutral
"Yes we are. So, coffee?",neutral
Hey sweetie.,neutral
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.,neutral
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am,neutral
I'm..,neutral
"And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.",neutral
"Yes, but y'know what?",neutral
"Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.",neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"I'm right, right?",neutral
Mrs. Braverman must be out.,neutral
And this is Rachel.,neutral
"It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....,neutral
"Ah, it’s still not the time.",neutral
You don't plan these things.,neutral
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,neutral
And a nice hot cider for Monica.,neutral
"So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?",neutral
"One, two, three.",neutral
"Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'",neutral
"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",neutral
I don’t know exactly.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",neutral
"And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.",neutral
I'll tell you what.,neutral
"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.",neutral
"Okay, that's, that's enough.",neutral
"Yes, at 4:00.",neutral
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.,neutral
"And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.",neutral
You must’ve had your hands full.,neutral
"Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.",neutral
"Okay,",neutral
At least you know her name.,neutral
Yep.,neutral
"Hmm, noodle soup.",neutral
"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those",neutral
"Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.",neutral
"You guys'll scooch, won't you?",neutral
Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.,neutral
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.,neutral
"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.",neutral
"Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",neutral
Age?,neutral
"There was just one woman, wasn’t there?",neutral
"Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me.",neutral
No.,neutral
And that’s how it’s done.,neutral
"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!",neutral
And a nice hot cider for Monica.,neutral
Oh!,neutral
"Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.",neutral
You want it?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"No, I don’t want to hit you.",neutral
"I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?",neutral
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was",neutral
"Oh, it’s okay.",neutral
Maybe.,neutral
"Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",neutral
"Good morning.  Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?",neutral
I’m still on the set!,neutral
Ross.,neutral
"No, you don't.",neutral
We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.,neutral
"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.",neutral
"So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?",neutral
"Well, he’s very charming.",neutral
I was just leaving.,neutral
"Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.",neutral
"Sure, what do you got?",neutral
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.,neutral
May I see your boarding pass?,neutral
I don’t think I should say.,neutral
"Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?",neutral
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.,neutral
"Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call?",neutral
"Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot.",neutral
I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.,neutral
"Yes, but y'know what?",neutral
"Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.",neutral
"Well I, I don't know. Why?",neutral
Hi guys.,neutral
Thanks man.,neutral
No.,neutral
"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.",neutral
"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",neutral
The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical...  bedroom.,neutral
"Yeah, I forget which ones.",neutral
"I don't know, what were the names I just said?",neutral
I mean.,neutral
They say he's only got half a tank left.,neutral
"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",neutral
"No, y’know what?",neutral
"Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk.",neutral
"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.",neutral
"No, I’m sorry.",neutral
Maybe we should check the trash chute.,neutral
Closer than here?,neutral
"C'mon, this is us.",neutral
"You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was",neutral
"Hey, you're not rich are ya?",neutral
I see. Have you considered therapy?,neutral
Need some help?,neutral
"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go.",neutral
"Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.",neutral
"Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?",neutral
Hey! What are you guys doing?,neutral
"No thanks, I’ve already seen one.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
All our love Monica and Chandler.,neutral
"He doesn't do much, does he?",neutral
"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.",neutral
"Yes, hi.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?",neutral
"I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?",neutral
So I'm thinking about you. So what?,neutral
"Yeah me too, all night.",neutral
Great nap.,neutral
Hey.,neutral
"But I'll still always come back, like this.",neutral
I like her.,neutral
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.,neutral
Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?,neutral
"Sorry I'm late, but I left late.",neutral
You take care Jill.,neutral
You're welcome.,neutral
"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.",neutral
The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical...  bedroom.,neutral
"No, no, no, that’s Dina.",neutral
So when are you getting married?,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Y'ever been in love?,neutral
"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",neutral
"That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.",neutral
"Um, yeah.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Intense and creepy.,neutral
"No, I haven't seen him.",neutral
I got it.,neutral
Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.,neutral
"Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.",neutral
I’d need an expense account.,neutral
"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.",neutral
"God, what a mess.",neutral
"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.",neutral
I,neutral
Just ignore them.,neutral
But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.,neutral
"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",neutral
Oh.. oh... oh.,neutral
That was,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
Just wait.,neutral
"Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.",neutral
"All right, I'm nine years old.",neutral
"Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",neutral
"We don’t, really.",neutral
"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",neutral
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.",neutral
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,neutral
The money will turn up!,neutral
"Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",neutral
"Okay, here comes another camera.",neutral
I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.,neutral
I'm sorry.,neutral
"Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it’s okay.",neutral
"Ohh, okay.",neutral
No.,neutral
"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",neutral
I have a question about this scene.,neutral
"Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right?",neutral
I don’t know.,neutral
"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",neutral
"Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.",neutral
"Ugh, she",neutral
"Well, what about you?",neutral
Like this.,neutral
"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",neutral
"It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?",neutral
"Hey, somebody left their keys.",neutral
Can we just start throwing things in?,neutral
"Hey guys, what are you doing?",neutral
"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.",neutral
No.,neutral
Ross has a boyfriend.,neutral
May I see it?,neutral
"Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.",neutral
"Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",neutral
"And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.",neutral
"Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.",neutral
I'm not your brother.,neutral
What?,neutral
"Joey, do you have a minute?",neutral
"Uff, I hope he lets her down easy.",neutral
"Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh?",neutral
"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.",neutral
"But I'll still always come back, like this.",neutral
So the going for help went well?,neutral
"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",neutral
"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",neutral
"I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.",neutral
Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street,neutral
I'll tell you what.,neutral
I went to Ross’s!,neutral
"I thought I would, but the translation's no good.",neutral
Am I interrupting?,neutral
"Okay, my next song’s called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.",neutral
What was her name?,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.,neutral
"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",neutral
"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",neutral
Maybe. Does that scare ya?,neutral
"As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.",neutral
Men are here.,neutral
"Oh no it’s fine, don’t worry about it.",neutral
"Yeah, someplace nice.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Don't listen to your mother.,neutral
Keep talking.,neutral
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.,neutral
"Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",neutral
"Yeah, okay, Scott!",neutral
"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Oh right.,neutral
"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real  nice and tight.",neutral
"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",neutral
I feel...,neutral
So what job did you get Joe?,neutral
Can't wait.,neutral
It's Danny.,neutral
"Well, you said that we except the",neutral
"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.",neutral
"What, like a number?",neutral
"You’re an Aquarius, huh?",neutral
No.,neutral
Yes.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"Now, I know what you’re thinking",neutral
These things happen!,neutral
I'm back.,neutral
"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.",neutral
Who’s Chip?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
I think it’s best sir.,neutral
Phonetically?,neutral
"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know?",neutral
"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",neutral
"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.",neutral
Thank you.,neutral
Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.,neutral
Wanna peek?,neutral
"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",neutral
"Well y’know what they say, the 23",neutral
"Y'know, someplace nice.",neutral
"I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?",neutral
"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.",neutral
"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",neutral
And how do I know?,neutral
I know.,neutral
Sure.,neutral
"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.",neutral
"Ben, you ready?",neutral
"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here.  Lily, from high school. Remember?",neutral
Hey!,neutral
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?,neutral
"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",neutral
"Now, I'm just letting you know that this is",neutral
"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so’s Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?",neutral
Thanks man.,neutral
"But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",neutral
"No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",neutral
"My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.",neutral
"Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.",neutral
"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know.",neutral
A little bigger.,neutral
Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.,neutral
And an assistant.,neutral
And you can see me!,neutral
"Me too, we should get goin'.",neutral
Ready?,neutral
"Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here.",neutral
"That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.",neutral
I’ll see you tomorrow.,neutral
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.,neutral
Paris?,neutral
I studied for a year in Barcelona.,neutral
"You look at me, and nothin’.",neutral
"Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",neutral
"Yeah, no they don’t do that.",neutral
I think that’s gum.,neutral
"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",neutral
"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",neutral
It's Jake.,neutral
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it —now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?,neutral
Sure.,neutral
I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.,neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,neutral
But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
"No, that was my way of telling you.",neutral
"Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?",neutral
No.,neutral
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.,neutral
And-,neutral
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.",neutral
"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",neutral
I’ll try.,neutral
Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.,neutral
"Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",neutral
Huh?,neutral
You mean with Casey.,neutral
"Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you.",neutral
"Yes, hi.",neutral
"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",neutral
Come on.,neutral
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.,neutral
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.,neutral
"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",neutral
Was your basket on top?,neutral
"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",neutral
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.,neutral
"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",neutral
"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.",neutral
"Ok, That's it, Ben.",neutral
A two and a five.,neutral
That’s not a bad idea.,neutral
"Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.",neutral
"Well, we are great guys.",neutral
"A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.",neutral
"Hello, Chip.",neutral
"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",neutral
You're you.,neutral
"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.",neutral
"Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.",neutral
That’s no problem.,neutral
"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",neutral
"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",neutral
What?,neutral
"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",neutral
Closer than here?,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
Also so,neutral
"I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go.",neutral
Still.,neutral
He doesn't have anyone.,neutral
"No, this is pretty much it.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.",neutral
"Yeah, y’know the license plate game?",neutral
"I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know?",neutral
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.,neutral
"Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?",neutral
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have",neutral
The first good thing she gets me in weeks.,neutral
"Okay, I had to put on lotion!",neutral
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,neutral
Sperm or regular?,neutral
I think I may be able to book,neutral
"With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",neutral
"Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.",neutral
"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.",neutral
"Okay, your highness.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.,neutral
Handling it?,neutral
"But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",neutral
I’m your mother.,neutral
"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?",neutral
"Mon, I don't understand.",neutral
About what?,neutral
I missed you.  I'm gonna get changed.,neutral
Hello?,neutral
"Hey man, you feeling any better?",neutral
"Look, I’ve been thinking about it.",neutral
Nothing.,neutral
"No, they’re-they’re all true.",neutral
"I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.",neutral
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.,neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding...",neutral
"Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.",neutral
So the Porsche guy took his car back.,neutral
"Yeah, because I was",neutral
"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",neutral
You're doin' this.,neutral
"Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs",neutral
"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.",neutral

He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.,neutral
"Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.",neutral
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.,neutral

"Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.",neutral
"Ciao, bela.",neutral
Let’s call ‘em.,neutral
Oh.,neutral
I’m your mother.,neutral

Bijan for men?,neutral
"Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a",neutral

Yeah.,neutral
"I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!",neutral
Really?,neutral
Heads it is.,neutral
"I know, but I’m a neurologist.",neutral
"No! Y’know,",neutral

"No, thank you.",neutral
Oh shoot! Maybe next time.  Thanks for a lovely evening.,neutral
"Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?",neutral

"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",neutral
No.,neutral
"Umm, no. No.",neutral
Can you tell me who is there please?,neutral
"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",neutral
You can spill. In the sink.,neutral
Human spleeeen.,neutral

"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",neutral
Pretty nice?,neutral
Chandler. I sensed it was you.,neutral
"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",neutral
That’s not a state Joe.,neutral
"No! Joey, you’re going to be great!",neutral
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,neutral
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.,neutral
"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!",neutral
"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",neutral
"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.",neutral
Are you sure you wanna do this?,neutral
"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",neutral
"Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.",neutral
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,neutral
"Okay, one thing at a time.",neutral
"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!",neutral
"Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there.",neutral
"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",neutral
Okay. Let's do it again.,neutral
"Hey, what have you guys been up too?",neutral
"So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.",neutral
"I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head.",neutral
Hold on.,neutral
"Oh, well we watch it a second time and its",neutral

"I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...",neutral
What happened?,neutral
"No, I let him win—Ross!",neutral
"Hey come on now, this is a real date.",neutral
"Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",neutral
"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?",neutral
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,neutral
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.,neutral
"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",neutral
David who?,neutral
"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",neutral
Sagittarius?,neutral
"And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.",neutral
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.,neutral
"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.",neutral
So you're a chef?,neutral
"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.",neutral
"I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Okay?,neutral
"No,",neutral
What?,neutral
It,neutral
"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.",neutral
"No, that was my way of telling you.",neutral
Because every time I look at that cover I’m like,neutral
"To the left, to the left- aww!",neutral
"I am sorry, but some of us have to",neutral
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,neutral
"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",neutral
": Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I’m ready to dance with girls.",neutral
It’s actually going to be just family.,neutral
It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.,neutral
"All right, gimme your foot.",neutral
I,neutral
"Okay, a little higher.",neutral
"Phoebe, what's the matter?",neutral
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.,neutral
Good morning.,neutral
All right.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",neutral
"Oh uh, I’m sorry.",neutral
I cannot sleep in a public place.,neutral
"""Heating device.""",neutral
"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.",neutral
"Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Is there anything we can do for you?,neutral
"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.",neutral
What?,neutral
No.,neutral
"which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.",neutral
"It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.",neutral
"Yeah, come on in.",neutral
This will be your phone.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world.",neutral
"Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story.",neutral
"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",neutral
"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.",neutral
"But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",neutral
Paid your phone bill?,neutral
"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",neutral
"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",neutral
"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.",neutral
"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.",neutral
"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?",neutral
"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.",neutral
"I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me.",neutral
Sure. So how long you been...,neutral
"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?",neutral
"Then we can put you in bed, okay?",neutral
"That's okay, Joe.",neutral
"Now, I know what you’re thinking",neutral
"I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.",neutral
"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?",neutral
"I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?",neutral
"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working",neutral
"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?""",neutral
Eh,neutral
"Okay, relax, relax.",neutral
Hm-mm,neutral
"Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.",neutral
"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?",neutral
"Well, I’m off to bed!",neutral
"Well, not right now.",neutral
I think that would be best.,neutral
"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",neutral
Y’know?,neutral
"We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"I’m Andrew, and I didn’t pay for this pear.",neutral
"Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.",neutral
You bet.  Maybe some other time?,neutral
"Yes, hello.",neutral
"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.",neutral
"I'm right, right?",neutral
"Oh, she does want to.",neutral
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,neutral
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.,neutral
"I'll be right there, Bernice.",neutral
"Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow.",neutral
in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from,neutral
Come on.,neutral
What d'you think?,neutral
And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!,neutral
"Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?",neutral
"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",neutral
Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",neutral
Whazzup??,neutral
"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",neutral
What a sweet story.,neutral
She's supposed to be very good.,neutral
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...,neutral
"So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",neutral
It’s Joey right?,neutral
Could've played,neutral
I think this can go somewhere.,neutral
Here.,neutral
"Oh, well I tell Issac everything.",neutral
"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?",neutral
Hi! How are the Gellers?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Who knows?,neutral
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.,neutral
"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.",neutral
"Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.",neutral
"Do-do you, do you have brothers?",neutral
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,neutral
"It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",neutral
"No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",neutral
"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?",neutral
How…How small are your feet?,neutral
What are you doing?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"But I'll still always come back, like this.",neutral
Let's dry 'em again.,neutral
Adiós.,neutral
Unagi. I’m always aware.,neutral
Oh. Well then shut me up.,neutral
Hey Bob.,neutral

"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.",neutral
"Oh, Hi, Ju——Hi, Jew!",neutral
"You guys'll scooch, won't you?",neutral
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.,neutral
Oh. You mind if I join you?,neutral
"All right, I'll see you in the morning.",neutral
"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?",neutral
He says he was too.,neutral
"Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.",neutral
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?,neutral
That's the rule.,neutral
"Yeah, we’re gonna go.",neutral
"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",neutral
You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.,neutral
"This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.",neutral
I know.,neutral
No.,neutral
That doesn’t lock does it?,neutral
"Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.",neutral
Just smile and don’t talk to,neutral
I’m not even… I’m not even,neutral
"I miss Janice though.  ""Hello, Chandler Bing.""",neutral
Hey?,neutral
"Oh, and deaf.",neutral
He's our friend.,neutral
"Wait, just a second.",neutral
Chandler.,neutral
"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.",neutral
"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...",neutral
No. Why?,neutral
"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.",neutral
I’m reading your ad.,neutral
"Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare.",neutral
"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one.",neutral
Uh-huh.,neutral
"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",neutral
Oh well,neutral
"No, from now on, I’m staying in one place.",neutral
"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?",neutral

So you’re playing a little,neutral
"But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",neutral
"Okay. And uh, are you married.",neutral
"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",neutral
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?,neutral
"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?",neutral
"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",neutral
I had a bra.,neutral
It’ll be okay Joe.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
I forgot my purse.,neutral
See?,neutral
"Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.",neutral
"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.",neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral
"Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.",neutral
"Okay umm, Ross?",neutral
No.,neutral
"All right, here we go.",neutral

"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.",neutral
"Carol, Kristin.",neutral
"So, if we could just get back to the lecture.",neutral
Anybody lose this?,neutral
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.,neutral
Steady.,neutral
"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",neutral
Um... Ross?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.",neutral
Just take him to like a ball game or something.,neutral
"Chip, is Chip Matthews.",neutral

"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right.",neutral
"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.",neutral
A little bigger.,neutral
"As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.",neutral
So when are you getting married?,neutral
"I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world.",neutral
Rdtor.,neutral

"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar",neutral
So what are you gonna do?,neutral
Oh right its that girl's phone number.,neutral

"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",neutral
"How many times have I told you guys, you",neutral
"Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?",neutral
Relax every muscle in your body.,neutral
I think this can go somewhere.,neutral
"Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?",neutral
"All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?",neutral
It’s gonna be okay.,neutral
"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!",neutral
Um... Ross?,neutral
"Ooh, dude. That’s not gonna happen.",neutral
"Joey, do you have a minute?",neutral
"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.",neutral
"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some",neutral
Let’s give it a shot.,neutral
"I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun.",neutral
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",neutral
"I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"No, no, to test his neck strength.",neutral
"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.",neutral

Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?,neutral
Hello.,neutral
No reason.,neutral
No.,neutral
That’s-that’s the real question.,neutral
"Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",neutral
"Last time I do that, I promise.",neutral
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.,neutral
"Oh, me too.",neutral
Nothing.,neutral
Isabella Rosselini.,neutral
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?,neutral
"Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",neutral

Where exactly is your zoo?,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
"Well, it’s getting late.",neutral

"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",neutral
‘Cause you’re still into Monica.,neutral
"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.",neutral

"I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.",neutral
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",neutral
"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",neutral
Hey-hey.,neutral
"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",neutral
So what’s up?,neutral

"But there are no boles, she’s smooth!",neutral
Hmm.,neutral

Ross.,neutral
"Oh, she does want to.",neutral
"Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",neutral

"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",neutral

"No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you.",neutral
"Well, that was ah...",neutral
Oh.  Thank you.,neutral
"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",neutral
"I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows.",neutral
How about we talk about this over dinner?,neutral
Drum roll.,neutral
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,neutral
No we,neutral
"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….",neutral
What are you doing?,neutral

How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,neutral
"Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.",neutral
"Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.",neutral
What do you mean?,neutral
"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",neutral

"Oh, good. Thanks.",neutral
You mean Dr. Geller?,neutral
We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?,neutral
They’re wildly unpopular.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,neutral
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,neutral
Thanks.,neutral
It's not just the drum noise.,neutral
"You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.",neutral
"I’m just saying, get his number just in case.",neutral
She’s sleeping.,neutral
Hello?,neutral
"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.",neutral
Sure!,neutral
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?,neutral
"Yeah, you’re right.",neutral
Adiós.,neutral
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.,neutral
"Hey, buddy.",neutral
"Oh, just this!  Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we",neutral
What?,neutral
"I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think.",neutral
"No, thank you.",neutral
"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.",neutral
"But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.",neutral
Here you go.,neutral
Huh?,neutral
"Hi, again.",neutral
"I, I don’t know.",neutral
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",neutral
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?,neutral
"But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.",neutral
"All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.",neutral
Oh y’know what?,neutral
"Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",neutral
Good-bye.,neutral
"I should uh, probably go.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
"I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn’t Have Left You That Way.",neutral
"Uh, the sex.",neutral
"You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",neutral
"Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?",neutral
"Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies.",neutral
"No, I can spot you from here.",neutral
"Okay, what else?",neutral
"Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
"But, okay.",neutral
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.,neutral
For him.,neutral
Here you go.,neutral
"So, um, what do you do for a living?",neutral
Good night.,neutral
"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.",neutral
Probably?,neutral
"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",neutral
"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",neutral
"Hi, Ross.",neutral
"Dad, Ronni's here.",neutral
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?,neutral
"Honey, what’s the matter?",neutral
"All right let me see.  Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?",neutral
I know it doesn't make much sense,neutral
Now you know how you really feel about it.,neutral
"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",neutral
"Honey, both yours.",neutral
"Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.",neutral
Focus.,neutral
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.,neutral
All right.,neutral
"Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.",neutral
They’ve been taping those people up there all day.,neutral
So why don’t you quit?,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Call me.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Come on.,neutral
"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-",neutral
"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",neutral
"All right Chandler, you’re up.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Your a poet and don't know it.,neutral
Maybe we could attack them together?,neutral
"Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!",neutral
"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",neutral
"Yeah, it’s not mine.",neutral
"Yeah, that really calms me down.",neutral
Hi.,neutral
"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",neutral
"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.",neutral
"Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.",neutral
"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.",neutral
"Yeah, you like that don’t you?",neutral
"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",neutral
"No, that was my way of telling you.",neutral
Good to know.,neutral
Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,neutral
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!,neutral
Not as each other!,neutral
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as too many women.,neutral
"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?",neutral
Going out with who?,neutral
"I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.",neutral
Alright. What's the message?,neutral
"No, I’m good.",neutral
Well yeah,neutral
What?,neutral
"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",neutral
Yeah...,neutral
"Ok, on three, Ben.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"Hi, here's the deal.",neutral
"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?",neutral
Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.,neutral
"No, so we’re protecting her.",neutral
Just a touch.,neutral
"So I got your car, it’s right outside.",neutral
"Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",neutral
"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.",neutral
"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.",neutral
"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross.",neutral
If only he were a woman.,neutral
"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",neutral
"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",neutral
Eh! There you go.,neutral
We don’t have to come up with this now.,neutral
"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",neutral
"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?",neutral
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?,neutral
"That was so awkward, we were really nervous.",neutral
"Felicity and I, we’re watching",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Can he handle the stick?,neutral
"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",neutral
You’ll see.,neutral
"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",neutral
"All right, that I’ll retract.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
I’m from Long Island.,neutral
"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",neutral
"Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.",neutral
Waaay too special.,neutral
"Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral
"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.",neutral
You have chalk on your face.,neutral
"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",neutral
Hey!,neutral
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?,neutral
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?,neutral
"No I’m serious, we should tell each other",neutral
He’s looking at me.,neutral
If you wanna put a label on it.,neutral
"Well, I’m gonna go get these  in some water.",neutral
"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.",neutral
"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",neutral
And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.,neutral
"So, see ya on Saturday.",neutral
"See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.",neutral
"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",neutral
That was the only way I could get him to,neutral
Thank you for calling attention to our error.,neutral
There is no father.,neutral
It’s pretty clear.,neutral
"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.",neutral
"Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",neutral
Bye.,neutral
"Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.",neutral
Where ya going?,neutral
"Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.",neutral
Ohhh... I'm fine.,neutral
"Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk.",neutral
"Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.",neutral
"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",neutral
"Hey, how you doin’?",neutral
"I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
You can take it off.,neutral
"Okay, relax, relax.",neutral
"I don’t see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!",neutral
Okay man.,neutral
Nothing.,neutral
What for?,neutral
I hope you do too.,neutral
"Ohhh, I",neutral
I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad.,neutral
"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment!",neutral
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.,neutral
That,neutral
"Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?",neutral
I,neutral
"Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I’m allowed to sleep with you.",neutral
"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",neutral
"Uh, okay, Pheebs?",neutral
I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.,neutral
Well…let’s just say,neutral
"Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things.",neutral
So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.,neutral
We have to assign heads to something.,neutral
"Yeah, it's in there.",neutral
"Can't do it, can you?",neutral
No.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
Oh well,neutral
But you found the keys to his clothes?,neutral
"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",neutral
I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.,neutral
"No, you're the best.",neutral
Nope.,neutral
"I mean, we're scientists, right?",neutral
"Yeah, I mean whatever.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?,neutral
"Oh, yeah. Had that dream.",neutral
I see.,neutral
That is true.,neutral
"You know, I mean, it's like we're different.",neutral
"I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.",neutral
"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.",neutral
Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.,neutral
"Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.",neutral
"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.",neutral
So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.,neutral
"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?",neutral
"Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.",neutral
"Hey, man. What's up?",neutral
"You should ah, you should just leave it.",neutral
No. We were in the middle of sex…and,neutral
"Hey Pheebs, what's going on?",neutral
"Oh please, could she",neutral
We’ll just see.,neutral
Exactly.,neutral
"That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better.",neutral
"Yeah, yeah, that's her.",neutral
Steady.,neutral
"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",neutral
I know.,neutral
That is true.,neutral
"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",neutral
Hello?  Eighth street deli?,neutral
"I mean, what’s the harm in that?",neutral
Thank you.,neutral
"So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember?",neutral
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of,neutral
"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.",neutral
"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.",neutral
"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya",neutral
"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
What's the opposite of man?,neutral
"Yeah, maybe.",neutral
"Yeah, can I help you with something?",neutral
Lot of things.,neutral
Show me where?,neutral
"Oh, yeah, sure.",neutral
Where?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.",neutral
That’s for coming buddy.,neutral
"No! No, fear of the number 13.",neutral
Well! Good night.  I’m going upstairs.,neutral
Apparently Howie’s editing now.,neutral
"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",neutral
"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
A dreamless sleep.,neutral
"No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t",neutral
Y’know what? I am,neutral
"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",neutral
"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",neutral
"Hey, Mon.",neutral
"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.",neutral
See you later Rach.,neutral
Yeah? The work problem?,neutral
All right.,neutral
"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?",neutral
"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.",neutral
"Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.",neutral
"Umm, this is nice.",neutral
"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.",neutral
Sincerely.,neutral
Did you know he was in there?,neutral
"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.",neutral
"No, this is pretty much it.",neutral
"What, like a number?",neutral
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,neutral
Didn’t you sleep together?,neutral
"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",neutral
"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.",neutral
"Okay, okay, what's going on?",neutral
"Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",neutral
That’ll be all.,neutral
"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.",neutral
"Who, who are they?",neutral
"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hi.,neutral
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.,neutral
"No-no, it was the candles.",neutral
"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?",neutral
"Yeah I can, it worked real well.",neutral
I'm intrigued.,neutral
"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.",neutral
"For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around.",neutral
"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",neutral
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,neutral
"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",neutral
Let me get it out before it sets.,neutral
"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",neutral
Who cares about them.,neutral
"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",neutral
All our love Monica and Chandler.,neutral
"Oh, that's",neutral
Right?,neutral
Great. Great.,neutral
Rachel didn't you just light that?,neutral
"Uh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?",neutral
"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.",neutral
"Uh fellas,",neutral
"What do you mean, like, buy it together?",neutral
"All right, honey, time to start pushing.",neutral
Oh! We could have done that.,neutral
"Okay, I had to put on lotion!",neutral
This is about us.,neutral
But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.,neutral
"Oh yeah, what are you reading?",neutral
"Either, it makes no difference.",neutral
Well do you want some help?,neutral
Thank you.,neutral
"Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.",neutral
"You gotta do it, man.",neutral
"Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.",neutral
"Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?",neutral
"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.",neutral
"No, this is a much better job.",neutral
"Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.",neutral
You are,neutral
"Yeah, maybe.",neutral
I don’t know anything about cooking.,neutral
"Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?",neutral
I can't,neutral
"All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Okay that’s, you know what that is?",neutral
But then this guy’s right after him.,neutral
Okay.  Every time.,neutral
"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.",neutral
"Y'know what, actually…  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",neutral
And now I have seen her naked.,neutral
All right?,neutral
"Carol, Kristin.",neutral
"Oh well, give it time.",neutral
"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!",neutral
What?,neutral
"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",neutral
"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",neutral
"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",neutral
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,neutral
Dangerous Liaisons,neutral
"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?",neutral
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.,neutral
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?,neutral
You wouldn’t happen to have a very big fork?,neutral
No problem.,neutral
"Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?",neutral
"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",neutral
"Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",neutral
The ride broke down.,neutral
"Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",neutral
"Uh, may I help you?",neutral
See?,neutral
"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.",neutral
"You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.",neutral
"It’s okay. Come, come on in.",neutral
"Y’know, there’s",neutral
Dear Mary-Angela.,neutral
"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy.",neutral
"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from",neutral
"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?",neutral
Y’know what I think it is?,neutral
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.,neutral
What's this?,neutral
"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.",neutral
"We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.",neutral
"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.",neutral
"Oh, I’m fine.",neutral
"Yes, of course.",neutral
Which one do you think she is?,neutral
No-no-no!,neutral
I'm with Hamilton!,neutral
"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the",neutral
I knew.,neutral
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",neutral
"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",neutral
Maybe two?,neutral
"Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?",neutral
"Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.",neutral
"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",neutral
"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",neutral
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.,neutral
"Look, I can listen to the radio, huh?",neutral
"Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.",neutral
Thread the needle.,neutral
That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?,neutral
"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",neutral
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?,neutral
"All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",neutral
"Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.",neutral
: What are you doing?,neutral
"Yeah, then you did that.",neutral
Thanks Rach.,neutral
"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides",neutral
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?,neutral
Hey guys!,neutral
"David, I'm pretending to",neutral
"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",neutral
"No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll",neutral
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...",neutral
"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..",neutral
"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.",neutral
It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a,neutral
Hi. She said yes.,neutral
"Not a fan, alright .",neutral
"Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8.",neutral
"Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.",neutral
"Oh, sorry.",neutral
"Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns?",neutral
Hey.,neutral
"I’m sorry, do I know you?",neutral
Don't listen to your mother.,neutral

"Yeah, they're not so bad.",neutral
"All right, call it in the air.",neutral
Have you seen Joey?,neutral

Good night.,neutral
"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.",neutral
"You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",neutral
Nestley Toulouse.,neutral
"Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story.",neutral
Hey guys.,neutral
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.,neutral
"Okay, Mon, back me up here.",neutral
No.,neutral
"Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it?",neutral
"One, two, three, four!",neutral
"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk",neutral
Smooth!,neutral
"Hey, you’re early.",neutral
"Well, thank you for lunch.",neutral
Good.,neutral
Is there anything we can do for you?,neutral
"No, y’know what?",neutral
Nah... not-not special enough.,neutral
"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",neutral
"Okay, relax, relax.",neutral
Rach? What are you doing?,neutral
"Your liking it, huh?",neutral
"I'll find Bob, I'll get him.",neutral
"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",neutral
"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.",neutral
Oh but you could.,neutral
She does want to.,neutral
"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",neutral
"Well, umm, not much.",neutral
"Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.",neutral
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Oh here’s a whole bunch.,neutral
"Well, you seem fine.",neutral
"Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",neutral
What?,neutral
"Hmm, noodle soup.",neutral
"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.",neutral
"Yeah, listen...",neutral
F.Y.I..,neutral
"Hey, this is hollow.",neutral
Better think of a new name for him.,neutral
All right. This is the kitchen.,neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Now, have you told anyone else?",neutral
"No, y’know what?",neutral
Hi Joey.,neutral
What were you doing?,neutral
Dime.,neutral
"So uh, what’s your name?",neutral

Nooo.,neutral
"Hmm, noodle soup.",neutral
"Hey, waiter.",neutral

Yes it is.,neutral
"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.",neutral
"Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.",neutral
"Mm, yum!",neutral

You mean they like you.,neutral
"No, cause I made lasagne.",neutral
What?,neutral
"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",neutral
I'll take sports.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.,neutral
"Hey, it’s me.",neutral
"Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should.",neutral
I'm sure they'll be here soon.,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",neutral
I hope it’s you.,neutral
"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.",neutral
Hey!,neutral
"Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.",neutral
"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time.",neutral
"Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window  Thread the needle.",neutral
Twice?,neutral
"I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think.",neutral
"Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.",neutral
"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",neutral
